That's Interesting! Towards a Phenomenology of Sociology and a Sociology of Phenomenology
By Murray S. Davis Phil. Soc. Sci. 1 (1971), 309-344 (Modified)

Summary
Question: How do theories that are generally considered interesting differ from theories that are generally considered non-interesting?

Answer: Interesting theories deny certain assumptions of their audience, while non-interesting theories affirm certain assumptions of their audience. This answer was arrived at through the examination of a number of famous social, and especially sociological, theories. That examination also generated a systematic index of the variety of propositional forms that interesting and non-interesting theories may take. The fertility of this approach suggested a new field be established called the Sociology of the Interesting, which is intended to supplement the Sociology of Knowledge. This new field will be phenomenologically oriented in so far as it will focus on the movement of the audience's mind from one accepted theory to another. It will be sociologically oriented in so far as it will focus on the dissimilar base-line theories of the various sociological categories that compose the audience. In addition to its value in interpreting the social impact of theories, the Sociology of the Interesting can contribute to our understanding of both the common sense and scientific perspectives on reality.

Part I: Introduction
It has long been thought that a theorist is considered great because his theories are true, but this is false. A theorist is considered great, not because his theories are true, but because they are interesting. Those who carefully and exhaustively verify trivial theories are soon forgotten, whereas those who cursorily and expediently verify interesting theories are long remembered. In fact, the truth of a theory has very little to do with its impact, for a theory can continue to be found interesting even though its truth is disputed — even refuted!

1

Since this capacity to stimulate interest is a necessary if not sufficient characteristic of greatness, then any study of theorists who are considered great must begin by examining why their theories are considered interesting — why, in other words, the theorist is worth studying at all. But before we can attempt even this preliminary task we must understand clearly why some theories are considered interesting while others are not. In this essay, I will try to determine what it means for a theory to be considered interesting (or, in the extreme, fascinating).

Students who follow to the letter all of the injunctions of current textbooks on theory-construction, but take into account no other criterion in the construction of their theories, will turn out work that will be found dull indeed. Their impeccably constructed theories will go unnoted — or, more precisely, unfootnoted — by others. But should these students also take into account that criterion, to be detailed below, that distinguishes interesting theories from uninteresting theories, they will find that their theories will make their readers literally sit up and take notice. Their theories will then be discussed among colleagues, examined in journals, confirmed or denied in dissertations, and taught to students as the most recent instances of progress in their profession.

I will confine my inquiry to social theories that have been considered interesting, giving special attention to famous sociological theories. I suggest, however, that the level of abstraction of the analysis presented here is high enough for it to be applicable equally well to theories in all areas of social science and even to theories in natural science. But this generalization of the following discussion will have to await further investigation.

1. Interesting non-propositions

I will further restrict this paper to analyzing the interesting component of those theories that Kant has called "synthetic a posteriori propositions" — assertions that refer to the empirical world and are not merely matters of definition. But these propositions, of course, are not the only ingredients of the scientific enterprise that may be found interesting, though they are the most important. Space, however, forbids consideration here of the various types of non-propositions that are also capable of evoking interest. Thus I will not be dealing with (1) findings, which confirm or disconfirm hypotheses, (2) clues, which indicate the way a problem can be solved, (3) aesthetic descriptions, which refine perception, (4) analogies, which render the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar, and (5) models, which simplify the integration of complex relationships.

 2. The interesting and the routine

The interesting is something that affects the attention. Websters Third defines interesting as "engaging the attention." The question naturally arises: Where was the attention before it was engaged by the interesting?

It is hard to answer this question because, by definition, one is usually not attentive to what one is usually not attentive to. But, for those who wish to understand human behavior, it is very important to answer this question because most people spend most of their lives in this state they are not attentive to. Harold Garfinkel (1967) has called this state of low attention or low consciousness "the routinized taken-for-granted world of everyday life." Since the interesting, by definition, engages the attention more than the non-interesting, perhaps the former can be used to make manifest the latter. I will attempt to use what is found interesting to disclose what is routinely taken-for-granted.

If the defining characteristic of anything that some audience considers interesting is that it stands out in their attention in contrast to the routinized taken-for-granted world of their everyday lives, then the defining characteristic of a theory that some audience considers interesting is that it stands out in their attention in contrast to the web of routinely taken-for-granted propositions that make up the theoretical structure of their everyday lives. In other words, a new theory will be noticed only when it denies an old truth (proverb, platitude, maxim, adage, saying, commonplace, etc.). (The actual process by which a theory comes to be considered interesting today is, of course, much more complicated because of the fragmentation of the audience into lay and professional groups. This important complication will be taken up in a later section.)

3. The interesting in theory and in practice

All interesting theories, at least all interesting social theories, then, attack the taken-for-granted worlds of their audiences. An audience will consider any particular proposition to be worth saying only if it denies the truth of some part of their routinely held assumption-ground. If it does not challenge but merely confirms one of their taken-for-granted beliefs, they will respond to it by rejecting its value while affirming its truth. They will declare that the proposition need not be stated because it is already part of their theoretical scheme: "Of course." "That's obvious." "Everybody knows that." "It goes without saying."

3

The taken-for-granted world includes not only this theoretical dimension but also a practical dimension. A theory will be considered truly interesting only if it has repercussions on both levels. On the latter level, an audience will find a theory to be interesting only when it denies the significance of part of their present "on-going practical activity" (Garfinkel, 1967) and insists that they should be engaged in some new on-going practical activity instead. If this practical consequence of a theory is not immediately apparent to its audience, they will respond to it by rejecting its value until someone can concretely demonstrate its utility: "So what?" "Who cares?" "Why bother?" "What good is it?"

An analysis of the rhetorical structure of social research reveals how it is made to seem interesting on both theoretical and practical levels. The standard form of the books and articles about this research is the following: (1) The author articulates the taken-for-granted assumptions of his imagined audience by reviewing the literature of the particular sub-tradition in question ("It has long been thought . . ."). (2) He adduces one or more propositions that deny what has been traditionally assumed ("But this is false . . ."). (3) He spends the body of the work proving by various methodological devices that the old routinely assumed propositions are wrong while the new ones he has asserted are right ("We have seen instead that . . ."). (4) In conclusion, he suggests the practical consequences of these new propositions for his imagined audience's on-going social research, specifically how they ought to deflect research onto new paths (Further investigation is necessary to . . .).

An analysis of the cognitive content of social research reveals much more about the nature of that which is interesting and, equally important, that which is not. Theoretically, it is worth investigating the social theories that have been considered interesting because of what they reveal about the common-sense every-day layman's view of the world, which they are attacking. Practically, it is worth investigating those social theories that have been considered interesting so that we can learn to assert interesting theories ourselves. If we come to understand the process by which interesting theories are generated, we will not have to continue to do what has been done up till now — leave the interesting to the inspired.

4. Procedure

To discover what made a social theory interesting, I examined a large number of social and especially sociological propositions that have been considered interesting, in the hope of isolating the common element of interest in all of them and of accounting for

4

their differences. Since my purpose was primarily heuristic, I did not feel it was necessary or feasible to establish the precise degree of interestability of each proposition. In a later section, 1 will offer some suggestions about how the study of interesting propositions can be put on a more rigorous footing. For the purposes of this investigation, I considered a social theory to be interesting if it has been in wide circulation. Wide circulation here is meant to encompass both those social theories that have been considered interesting in times past and those that have been considered interesting recently — that is, those that were and those that are in the air. (The former are now usually taught to students in introductory courses; the latter in substantive courses beyond the introductory level.) I also examined for this investigation some well-turned propositions of popular sociology that have caught the public's fancy and have achieved a wide circulation outside the strict limits of the discipline's domain.

5. The common element of all interesting propositions

All of the interesting propositions I examined were found to involve the radical distinction between seeming and being, between the subject of phenomenology and the subject of ontology. An interesting proposition was one that first articulated a phenomenological presumption about the way a particular part of the world had looked, and then denied this phenomenological presumption in the name of truth, that is, in the name of a more profound, more real, more ontological criterion. Put more precisely, an interesting proposition was one that attempted first to expose the ontological claim of its accredited counterpart as merely phenomenological pretence, and then to deny this phenomenological pretence with its own claim to ontological priority. In brief, an interesting proposition was always the negation of an accepted one. All of the interesting propositions I examined were easily translatable into the form: "What seems to be X is in reality non-X" or "What is accepted as X is actually non-X."

6. The species of interesting propositions

While all interesting propositions were found to have in common the same dialectical relation between the phenomenological and the ontological, they were found to be distinguished on the logical level. The variety of interesting propositions fell into twelve logical categories that involved either the characterization of a single phenomenon or the relations among multiple phenomena. These twelve logical categories constitute an Index of the Interesting.

Part II: The Index of the Interesting
5

A — The Characterization of a single phenomenon

(i) Organization

a. What seems to be a disorganized (unstructured) phenomenon is in reality an organized (structured) phenomenon.

Example: Ferdinand Tonnies' assertion in Community and Society that the relations among people within all societies were considered at the time he wrote to be manifold and indeterminate, can in fact be organized around two main types (Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft).

b. What seems to be an organized (structured) phenomenon is in reality a disorganized (unstructured) phenomenon.

Example: Karl Marx's assertion in Capital that the economic processes of bourgeois society, which were considered at the time he wrote to be organized in one way, are in fact not organized in that way (but rather organized in another way).

Comment: The thrust of a younger ripening discipline is to develop organizing propositions of Type (i)a. Perhaps the most fundamental example in sociology is Auguste Compte's assertion that social phenomena in themselves, which were considered at the time he wrote to be unstructured (unlike natural phenomena), do in fact possess a coherent structure that can be grasped by science. The major sub-fields of a discipline also begin with the assertion of an organization for a particular social phenomenon that was thought to be unorganized. Thus Gustave LeBon started the field of Collective Behavior when he managed to structure something so seemingly chaotic as crowds. Organizing propositions often appear abbreviated as concepts. Cooley, for example, managed to organize the apparently amorphous middle distance between the individual and the society with his notion of the "primary group."

Talcott Parsons, certainly the most famous living organizer of both social theories and social processes, acquired his renown mostly for propositions of Type (i)a. In his early work (The Structure of Social Action), he asserts that four early twentieth-century social theorists (Marshall, Durkheim, Pareto, and Weber), who were considered at the time he wrote to be dealing with completely different social phenomena in completely different ways, are in fact all saying essentially the same thing about the same general social

6

phenomenon. And in his later work (Economy and Society), he asserts that four major social institutions (familial, cultural, political, and economic), which were considered at the time he wrote to be relatively uncoordinated with one another, are in fact all strictly integrated into a coherent social system.

The thrust of an older stagnating discipline in need of rejuvenation is to develop Disorganizing or critical propositions of Type (i)b. Each disorganizing proposition criticizes the adequacy of the previously accepted organizing proposition (though nearly always calling for the substitution of a new organizing proposition rather than merely claiming the phenomenon is completely incapable of being structured). Classic examples of successful attempts to disorganize accepted organizations include Ward's critique of Social Darwinism and Mead's critique of Watsonian Behaviorism. Recent critiques of accepted organizations in modern sociology entailing Type (i)b propositions include Denis Wrong's attack on its models, Harold Garfinkel's attack on its methods, and Alvin Gouldner's attack on its politics.

Note that not just any organizing proposition is interesting: only those that organize phenomena that had seemed too complex or chaotic to be ordered. And not just any critical proposition is interesting: only those that criticize previous organizations of phenomena that had become generally accepted.

(ii) Composition

a. What seem to be assorted heterogeneous phenomena are in reality composed of a single element.

Example: Sigmund Freud's assertion throughout his Collected Works that the behavior of children, primitives, neurotics, and adults in crowds, as well as dreams, jokes, and slips of the tongue and pen, which were considered at the time he wrote to be unassociated in any way with one another, are in fact all various manifestations of the same instinctual drives

b. What seems to be a single phenomenon is in reality composed of assorted heterogeneous elements.

Example: Max Weber's assertion in Economy and Society that the stratification system, which was considered at the time he wrote to be monolithic, is in fact composed of the three independent variables of economic class, status prestige, and political power.

7

Comment: Many natural and social scientists have made their reputations by pointing out that the appearance of a natural or social phenomenon is an illusion and that what the phenomenon really consists of lies below its surface. Their profound insight is considered especially interesting when these theorists also assert that the fundamental nature (depth structure) of the phenomenon contradicts the surface impression, as, for example, the seemingly continuous appearance of a table is contradicted by the discrete molecules of which it is actually composed. Usually, these scientists have pointed out a single factor that underlies what had heretofore seemed heterogeneous phenomena. In the social sciences, such monofactoral theorists as Marx, Nietzsche, and McLuhan have reduced a large number of seemingly diverse social phenomena down to their economic, power, or communicative components. Other social theorists who have observed that a few seemingly diverse social phenomena have at least one component in common have achieved less ambitious, but nonetheless interesting, reductions. Thus Simmel in his Sociology showed that the "triadic form", and the interaction processes associated with it, underlay both the three-person family and the three-class society.

Interesting propositions of the opposite type, (ii)b, occur when a theorist manages to distinguish several factors that compose a phenomenon previously thought to be unitary. Talcott Parsons, who has tried his hand at analysis as well as synthesis, constructed a Type (ii)b proposition in The Social System when he asserted that Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, each of which was considered at the time he wrote to be an indivisible phenomenon, are in fact composed of several independent (pattern) variables.

Paul Lazarsfeld and Allan Barton (1955) have distinguished both types of composition propositions in empirical sociological research. Those research methods that produce Type (ii)a propositions they call "reduction". Reduction consists of methods to simplify complex classifications (indices). Those research methods that produce Type (ii)b propositions they call "substruction". Substruction consists of methods to elaborate simple classifications (typologies).

In each of the social sciences today, the major schools of thought are often modeled after either Continental Structuralism or English Analytic Philosophy. Those schools derived from Continental Structuralism have tried to make their output interesting by developing methodological procedures designed to turn out propositions of Type (ii)a. Those schools derived from English Analytic Philosophy have tried to make their output interesting by developing methodological procedures designed to turn out propositions of Type (ii)b.

8

More generally, we may say that those who assert Type (ii)a propositions are disciples of the Platonic Tradition in which interesting propositions are generated by finding simplicity in the apparently complex; whereas those who assert Type (ii)b propositions are disciples of the Aristotelian Tradition in which interesting propositions are generated by finding complexity in the apparently simple.

(iii) Abstraction

a. What seems to be an individual phenomenon is in reality a holistic phenomenon.

Example: Emile Durkheim's assertion in Suicide that suicide, which was considered at the time he wrote to be a behavior characteristic of an individual, is in fact (more crucially) a process characteristic of a society.

b. What seems to be a holistic phenomenon is in reality an individual phenomenon.

Example:Sigmund Freud's assertion in Thoughts for the Times on War and Death that war, which was considered at the time he wrote to be a social phenomenon, is in fact (more crucially) a psychological phenomenon.

Comment: Holistic propositions of Type (iii)a assert that what appears to be the property of an individual is actually the property of some whole of which the individual is a part. In the social sciences, using Type (iii)a propositions as a technique for getting audience attention is usually called "sociologizing" or "sociological imperialism." Along with suicide, two other seemingly individual phenomena that have been fruitfully subject to sociologizing are embarrassment (Goffman) and sleep (Aubert and White).

Particularistic propositions of Type (iii)b assert that what appears to be the property of a whole is actually the property of the individuals that make up this whole. In the social sciences, using Type (iii)b propositions as a technique for getting audience attention is usually called "psychologizing" or "psychological reductionism". Freud, of course, is the classic psychologizer of social phenomena, finding instinctual roots for such seemingly social phenomena as totems and taboos, among numerous other examples. Recently, the seemingly social fact that nations wage war over land has been explained by the newly discovered individual instinct for "territoriality" (Lorenz, Ardrey).

9

(It is instructive to note that Vilfredo Pareto's reduction of various social phenomena to their psychological roots — "residues" — attracted much less interest in America than Freud's. Though Pareto wrote on these ics first, his work crossed the ocean last, after Freud and others had already succeeded in transforming the American assumption-ground and accustoming Americans to expect that many social phenomena would have a psychological basis. Other areas of Pareto's thought, however, which he considered more minor, succeeded in attracting more interest.)

A third type of abstraction proposition has recently appeared in the social sciences. It attempts to interest its audience by denying the assumptions of both Type (iii)a and Type (iii)b propositions. This type of proposition asserts that the real locus of human phenomena is neither the individual level nor the social level, but rather some intermediate social-psychological level. A social-psychological explanation of a phenomenon will be found interesting, however, only when the phenomenon has already been explained both psychologically and sociologically, and the dispute between those who uphold each of these explanations has grown heated.

(iv) Generalization

a. What seems to be a local phenomenon is in reality a general phenomenon.

Example: Karl Mannheim's assertion in Ideology and Uia that the ideological limitation and distortion of thought processes, which was considered at the time he wrote to effect only the bourgeois class, in fact effects all social classes.

b. What seems to be a general phenomenon is in reality a local phenomenon.

Example: Bronislaw Malinowski's assertion in Sex and Repression in Savage Society that the Oedipus complex, which was considered at the time he wrote to be a human universal, in fact does not occur in all societies.

Comment: Generalizing propositions and localizing propositions are two of the most common types of propositions in modern social science research. In fact, the main objective of methodology in the social sciences today seems to be to establish rigorous procedures that will determine the exact degree to which some assertion about social life can be generalized.

10

Although the tendency of the great social theorists of the past was to assert some truth about human life that held universally, the common tendency today of such divergent sociological schools as ethnomethodology and survey research, as well as Anglo-American anthropology, is to localize assertions and emphasize sub-group variation. In the past, attempts would be made to show that some behavioral characterization holds for all humanity; in the present, attempts are made to show that some behavioral characterization holds for some groups and tribes, but not for others.

A theorist makes an interesting generalization when he asserts that some property that everyone knows to characterize one social category also characterizes another social category where its existence was not suspected. Freud, for example, tried to show that the sexual impulse was a major influence not only on the behavior of adults (which was fairly obvious), but also on the behavior of children (which was not so obvious).

A theorist makes an interesting localization when he asserts that some property, that is thought to characterize everybody — to be part of human nature — belongs merely to one social category and not others. Edward Hall, for example, tried to show that many problems in inter-cultural contact stem from those in one society believing those in all other societies attach the same meaning to spatial features as they do; whereas in fact the interpretation of crucial aspects of the spatial dimension varied considerably in different societies.

(v) Stabilization

a. What seems to be a stable and unchanging phenomenon is in reality an unstable and changing phenomenon.

Example: Karl Marx's assertion in Capital that the social organization of bourgeois society, which was considered at the time he wrote to be permanent, is in fact about to be suddenly and dramatically transformed.

b. What seems to be an unstable and changing phenomenon is in reality a stable and unchanging phenomenon.

Example: Georg Simmel's assertion in Conflict that any conflict-ridden social organization, which was considered at the time he wrote to be on the verge of transformation, may in fact be capable of continuing indefinitely as it is (in a steady-state of conflict).

11

Comment: Just as some propositions are interesting because they assert an unexpected generalization or lack of generalization of the characteristics of a social phenomenon across some social category space, so other propositions are interesting because they assert an unexpected stabilization or lack of stabilization of the characteristics of a social phenomenon across time. Propositions of Type (v) fall within the range of historical sociology that is concerned with demonstrating the temporal continuity or change of social phenomena.

One wing of historical sociology tries to construct interesting propositions of Type (v)a by demonstrating the surprising instability and even change of seemingly stable social phenomena. The New Left historical sociologists, for instance, assert that American society, which was considered at the time they wrote to have been held together in the past by a basic value consensus, has in fact had a long history of disruption, conflict, violence, and incipient disintegration. On a smaller scale, Berger and Luckmann in The Social Construction of Reality have pointed out that all enduring social institutions do not continue to exist "naturally" as had been thought, but must develop elaborate maintenance mechanisms to ward off the constant threats to their stability.

The other wing of historical sociology tries to construct interesting propositions of Type (v)b by demonstrating the surprising stability and even permanence of seemingly unstable social phenomena. Besides Simmel and the "functions of social conflict" theorists like Lewis Coser who attempt to show how those processes of a social phenomenon that appear self-destructive are actually those processes that are helping the social phenomenon to maintain itself, this wing also includes those archetypal theorists like the New-Freudian Lewis Feuer in The Conflict of Generations and the New-Jungian Phillip Slater in Microcosm who interpret social phenomena that appear violent and disruptive, such as student riots against college administrators and group revolts against their leaders, as merely the most recent repetition and manifestation of an original and ongoing paradigmatic pattern of human behavior.

(vi) Function

a. What seems to be a phenomenon that functions ineffectively as a means for the attainment of an end is in reality a phenomenon that functions effectively.

Example: Robert Merton's assertion in Social Theory and Social Structure that the political machine, which was considered at the time he wrote to be an inefficient

12

institution for obtaining community goals, is in fact an efficient institution for obtaining community goals.

b. What seems to be a phenomenon that functions effectively as a means for the attainment of an end is in reality a phenomenon that functions ineffectively.

Example: Herbert Marcuse's assertion in Repressive Tolerance that the tradition of tolerance in America, which was considered at the time he wrote to be a value that fostered the goal of a liberated society, is in fact a value that hindered the goal of a liberated society.

Comment: Merton's discussion of manifest and latent functions (1957) is the classic statement of a methodological technique specifically designed to generate interesting propositions. His approach is similar to the one presented here, though confined only to one type of interesting proposition (Type (vi)).

Merton tells the social theorist to proceed in the following way. In the light of the social theorist's "deeper" insight into the actual workings of some social phenomenon, he has first to deny what Merton calls its manifest (i.e. generally apparent) function or dysfunction, and then to reveal what Merton calls its latent (i.e. not generally apparent) function or dysfunction. Though Merton does not say so specifically, he strongly implies that the latent function or dysfunction of the social phenomenon must be the opposite of its manifest dysfunction or function.

Type (vi)a propositions have conservative political implications: one should not try to change an obviously defective social institution that in reality has useful consequences. In other words, the social theorist claims that a certain social institution, of which his audience is known to disapprove, actually has consequences, of which his audience is known to approve. Popular examples of Type (vi)a propositions would be "Witch doctors really are effective at curing their patients" and "Folk remedies for illness turn out to be really effective."

Type (vi)b propositions have radical political implications: one should try to change a seemingly successful social institution that in reality has destructive consequences. In other words, the social theorist claims that a certain social institution, of which his audience is known to approve, actually has consequences, of which his audience is known to disapprove. Popular examples of Type (vi)b propositions would be "Jails really

13

turn out criminals", "Schools really make children stupid", and "Mental hospitals really make people mentally ill."

Though there is no necessary theoretical reason why these two types of propositions should not arise with equal frequency, Merton and his followers have come up with more Type (vi)a propositions, while Radical Sociologists have come up with more Type (vi)b propositions.

(vii) Evaluation

a. What seems to be a bad phenomenon is in reality a good phenomenon.

Example: R. D. Laing's assertion in The Politics of Experience that schizophrenia, which was considered at the time he wrote to be a bad thing, is in fact a good thing.

b. What seems to be a good phenomenon is in reality a bad phenomenon.

Example: Fried rich Nietzsche's assertion in On the Genealogy of Morals that Christian morality, which was considered at the time he wrote to be a good thing, is in fact a bad thing.

Comment: Evaluative propositions are found interesting only when the theorist's evaluation of a phenomenon differs from his audience's evaluation of this phenomenon. There are two ways in which the theorist can come up with such a re-evaluation of accepted values.

First, he can change the rating of a phenomenon by changing the indicator (operational definition) of the phenomenon to be rated. Depending on his audience's appraisal, he can select either the best or the worst particular aspects of the phenomenon to stand for the phenomenon as a whole. Should his audience customarily view the phenomenon in its best light, he can then view it in its worst, and vice versa. Thus, if a social theorist wishes to counter his audience's appraisal of American Society as great or as awful, he need merely select, to serve as his indicators of the moral worth of American Society as a whole, those of its aspects that are generally considered bad (like pollution, pockets of poverty, materialism, etc.) or those of its aspects that are generally considered good (like technology, average income, abundant consumer goods, etc.).

14

Second, he can change the rating of a phenomenon by changing the moral measure to which it is being compared. Something is judged good or bad relative to some standard of good or bad. Change the standard of comparison and the evaluation of the phenomenon is also likely to change. Should his audience customarily evaluate a phenomenon positively relative to one comparison baseline, he can then evaluate it negatively relative to another comparison baseline, and vice versa. Comparison baselines for a social phenomenon include (1) other social phenomena of the same logical type, (2) the same social phenomenon in the past (recent or distant), (3) future projections of the social phenomenon (short run or long run), and (4) some positive or negative ideal version of the social phenomenon. Thus if a social theorist wishes to counter his audience's appraisal of American Society as great or as awful, he need merely compare it to (1) other societies (Sweden, Nazi Germany, etc.), (2) its past history (the Gay Nineties, the Depression, etc.), (3) its potential futures (2001, 1984, etc.) or (4) some uian or disian society (Marx's pure communism, Hobbes' state of nature, etc.).

(Notice that all disputes about the moral worth of American Society as a whole are actually disputes about what aspects of American Society are to be used as indicators for this evaluation and what comparison baselines are to be used to evaluate them. In fact, disputes about the moral worth of all social phenomena can be reduced to disputes involving these same two factors.)

Evaluative propositions are common in social research, but, because of the norm of ethical neutrality, some theorists prefer to make their value judgements more latent than blatant. Without ever explicitly stating their appraisal of a social phenomenon, they can communicate their appraisal implicitly by demonstrating the ways in which this social phenomenon is similar to another social phenomenon whose moral status is generally accepted. By means of this strategy, Goffman, in Asylums, subtly passes judgement on the moral status of mental hospitals by showing how remarkably many features they have in common with concentration camps.

B — The Relations Among Multiple Phenomena

(viii) Co-relation

a. What seem to be unrelated (independent) phenomena are in reality correlated (interdependent) phenomena.

15

Example: August Hollingshead's assertion in Social Class and Mental Illness that social class and mental illness, which were considered at the time he wrote to be uncorrelated, are in fact correlated.

b. What seem to be related (interdependent) phenomena are in reality uncorrelated (independent) phenomena.

Example: Emile Durkeim's assertion in Suicide that suicide and such other phenomena as psychopathological states, race, heredity, and climate, which were considered at the time he wrote to be correlated, are in fact uncorrelated.

Comment: Modern computer technology in the social sciences both allows and fosters the prolific production of an enormous number of propositions involving correlations among phenomena (Type (viii)) that are uninteresting. These correlative propositions are uninteresting because they are obvious, because everyone already knew the phenomena in question were related. It is the rare computer correlation that draws attention to a surprising relation among phenomena that everyone did not already expect. Qualitative correlations are more likely to be interesting than quantitative correlations because the human mind, unlike the computer, is programmed (in various degrees of clarity) with the additional rule for the construction of interesting propositions described in this paper. This additional step in one's mental program between conception and assertion serves as a filter to screen out (censor) those correlative propositions that are not worth saying.

Social theorists have pointed out many interesting correlations among phenomena that previously had been thought to be uncorrelated. Using Type (viii)a propositions, they have asserted connections between such seemingly unconnected phenomena as social organization and culture (Marx, Durkheim), society and self (Cooley, Mead), group pressure and individual perception (Asch), living standard and population growth (Malthus), birth order and personality traits.

Social theorists have pointed out the absence of correlation among phenomena thought to be correlated less often than the presence of correlation among phenomena thought to be uncorrelated. Interesting propositions of Type (viii)b are rarer than interesting propositions of Type (viii)a because the social theorist's audience assume social phenomena to be uncorrelated more often than they assume social phenomena to be correlated. Nevertheless, social theorists have asserted a few intriguing disassociations among phenomena whose associations have been assumed, such as the disconnection

16

between the self and the body (Mead, Goffman) and the disconnection between power and authority (Tocqueville).

In the popular press, perhaps the best examples of both Type (viii)a propositions and Type (viii)b propositions can be found in attempts to link various forms of smoking and various forms of illness. The public's interest was aroused with the first publication of studies that found statistical correlations between cigarette smoking and illness because the public had previously thought there was no connection between these two phenomena (Type (viii)a proposition). The public's interest was also aroused with the first publication of studies that found little or no statistical correlation between marijuana smoking and illness because the public had previously thought there was a strong connection between these two phenomena (Type (viii)b proposition).

(ix) Co-existence

a. What seem to be phenomena that can exist together are in reality phenomena that cannot exist together.

Example: Denis de Rougemont's assertion in Love in the Western World that love and marriage, which were considered at the time he wrote to be compatible, are in fact incompatible.

b. What seem to be phenomena that cannot exist together are in reality phenomena that can exist together.

Example: Sigmund Freud's assertion in Notes on a Case of Obsessional Neurosis that love and hate, which were considered at the time he wrote to be incompatible, are in fact compatible (in the psychological state of ambivalence).

Comment: This type of interesting proposition is relatively rare in the social sciences since few pairs or sets of social phenomena are conceived as being so incompatible with one another that they negate one another's very existence. Type (ix)b propositions, however, are more common that Type (ix)a propositions: when two or more social phenomena are assumed to be incompatible, they are usually assumed to be strongly incompatible, and therefore the jolt of the interesting is likely to occur whenever they are asserted to coexist; whereas when two or more social phenomena are assumed to be compatible, they are usually assumed to be weakly compatible, and therefore the jolt of

17

the interesting is not likely to occur whenever they are asserted to be incapable of coexistence.

The intensive interest generated by the dynamic ambiguity of Type (ix)b propositions encourages their use as inspired titles and catch phrases. "The Lonely Crowd", "The Cold War" (i.e., "The Peaceful War"), and "Poverty in the Midst of Plenty" are all actually Type (ix)b propositions in elliptical form.

(x) Co-variation

a. What seems to be a positive co-variation between phenomena is in reality a negative co-variation between phenomena.

Example: David Caplovitz's assertion in The Poor Pay More that expenditures for many goods and services, which were considered at the time he wrote to decrease at the lower income levels, in fact increase at the lower income levels.

b. What seems to be a negative co-variation between phenomena is in reality a positive co-variation between phenomena.

Example: Alexis de Tocqueville's assertion in The Old Regime and the French Revolution that a social groups desire for revolution, which was considered at the time he wrote to decrease as their standard of living goes up, in fact increases as their standard of living goes up.

Comment: There are two other types of co-variance propositions that attract interest: (1) What seems to be a continuous (incremental) co-variation between phenomena is in reality a discontinuous (discrete) co-variation. The Marxist notion of the point at which a quantitative change suddenly turns into a qualitative change involves this type of proposition. (2) What seems to be a linear co-variation between phenomena is in reality a curvilinear co-variation. This type of proposition occurs whenever extremes are said to come together, i.e. to be more similar to each other than they are to the mean. This pattern is often found in (a) Stratification Correlates — when the upper class and the lower class are asserted to be more similar on some trait than either is to the middle class — (b) Hierarchical organization correlates — when the management and the

workers are asserted to be more similar on some trait then either is to the middle management — and (c) Historical-Demographic Correlates — when primitive society

18

and modern society are asserted to be more similar on some trait than either is to historically intervening societies.

(xi) Opposition

a. What seem to be similar (nearly identical) phenomena are in reality opposite phenomena.

Example: Marshall McLuhan's assertion in Understanding Media that radio and television, which were considered at the time he wrote to be similar media, are in fact opposite media (one being a hot medium; the other being a cool medium).

b. What seem to be opposite phenomena are in reality similar (nearly identical) phenomena.

Example: Eric Hoffer's assertion in The True Believer that the psychological motivations of those who join opposing social movements, which were considered at the time he wrote to be opposite, are in fact similar.

Comment: When opposition propositions, especially of type (xi)b, are combined with evaluation propositions, especially of Type (vii)b, we have the relatively formalized technique of generating interesting propositions known as dialectical thinking. A social theorist uses this technique of dialectical thinking whenever be tries to elicit his audience's interest by asserting that a seemingly positive social phenomenon actually has the negative characteristics of the opposite social phenomenon, or occasionally vice versa. Perhaps the most famous example of dialectical thinking is the Marxian (actually Proudhonian) assertion that "Ownership is theft."

Sometimes a transformational process must be added to bring about the identification of the apparent opposites — as in "Disgust is repressed desire" and "Marriage is legalized prostitution." This transformational process, however, merely makes the proposition possible and contributes little to its impact. The intensity of the proposition's impact is due not to its adjectival and unstressed transformational process, but to the one-two punch of its sudden logical and evaluational reversal.

Though this double negation of accepted concepts and values appeals to Continental social theorists, it is often too extreme for the Anglo-American mind, which consequently tends to consider dialectical propositions more bizarre than interesting. Hence their

19

applause when the Englishman Orwell satirized these dialectical propositions in 1984 with such hyperbolic examples as "Freedom is slavery", "War is peace", and "Ignorance is strength."

(xii) Causation

a. What seems to be the independent phenomenon (variable) in a causal relation is in reality the dependent phenomenon (variable).

Example: Howard Becker's assertion in Outsiders that the peculiar behavior of some individuals, which was considered at the time he wrote to cause other people to label them deviants, is in fact caused by other people labeling them deviants.

b. What seems to be the dependent phenomenon (variable) in a causal relation is in reality the independent phenomenon (variable).

Example: Max Weber's assertion in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism that the religion of a society, which was considered at the time he wrote to be determined by the economy of the society, in fact determines the economy of the society.

Comment: Type (xii) propositions, which evoke interest by reversing the causal relationship usually assumed between phenomena, are especially common in popular sociology. Such journalistic subjects are "How the American judicial system was actually on trial during the Chicago Seven conspiracy case," "How victims actually cause crimes," and "How schools disrupt childhood" are all ultimately based on Type (xii) propositions.

There is a third variety of causal proposition that stimulates interest against the ground assumption of the first two: What seems to be a simple one way causal relation between phenomena is actually a complex mutual interaction between phenomena. Scholars who have read Max Weber's entire Sociology of Religion continually point out that he does not exclusively define either religion or economy as the independent or the dependent phenomenon, as dilettantes who have read only his Protestant Ethic assume; rather he actually shows how both the religion and the economy of a society reciprocally influence each other's development.

Part III: Discussion
1. Non-interesting propositions

20

We have seen that an audience finds a proposition interesting not because it tells them some truth they did not already know, but instead because it tells them some truth they thought they already knew was wrong. In other words, an interesting proposition is one that denies some aspect of the assumption-ground of its audience, and in The Index of the Interesting we have categorized the various aspects of this assumption-ground that can be denied. Since this is the defining characteristic of an interesting proposition, it can also be used as a criterion to determine whether or not a particular proposition is interesting.

If the criterion by which an audience judges a particular proposition to be interesting is that it denies some aspect of their assumption-ground, then the criterion by which they will judge a particular proposition to be non-interesting is that it does not deny some aspect of their assumption-ground. There are three ways in which a proposition can fail to deny some aspect of the assumption-ground of its audience, and therefore there are three general types of propositions that will be found non-interesting by their audience.

First, an audience will consider a proposition to be non-interesting if, instead of denying some aspect of their assumption-ground, the proposition affirms some aspect of their assumption-ground.1 (E.g.: "Husbands often influence their wives' political behavior.") In effect, the proposition is saying to its audience: What seems to be the case is in fact the case. What you always thought was true is really true. Phenomenology is ontology. The audience's response to propositions of this type will be: "That's obvious!"

Second, an audience will consider a proposition to be non-interesting if, instead of denying or affirming some aspect of their assumption-ground, the proposition does not speak to any aspect of this assumption-ground at all. (E.g.: "Eskimos are more likely than Jews to. . .") In effect, the proposition is saying to its audience: What is really true has no connection with what you always thought was true. Phenomenology is unrelated to ontology. The audience's response to propositions of this type will be: "That's irrelevant!"

Third, an audience will consider a proposition to be non-interesting if, instead of denying some aspect of their assumption-ground, the proposition denies the whole assumption-ground. (E.g.: "Social factors have no effect on a person's behavior.") In effect, the proposition is saying to its audience: Everything that seems to be the case is not the case at all. Everything you always thought was true is really false.

21

Phenomenology is completely contrary to ontology. T he audience's response to propositions of this type will be: "That's absurd!"

Why would anyone bother to assert a non-interesting proposition? Non-interesting social theories are often asserted on purpose by those who think that the business of social scientists is merely to assert any theory that can be derived and confirmed according to the textbook rules of theory construction and verification. Actually, the mediocre in the social sciences (and probably the natural sciences too) can be defined as those who take the textbook rules of scientific procedures too literally and too exclusively. It should be clear from the above discussion that those who lack what is called "the creative spark" are in fact those who fail to take into account the assumption-grounds of their audiences.2

But even the Stars of social science sometimes assert propositions found to be non-interesting. Why should this ever be the case? Besides the occasional fall of the Stars themselves into mediocrity, the fault may lie not in the Stars, but in their audience. Propositions are interesting or uninteresting only in relation to the assumption-ground of some audience. If an audience finds a proposition asserted by a reputable social scientist to be obvious or irrelevant or absurd, it may be because the proposition has come to the attention of an audience other than the one to whom it was originally intended. A proposition that merely affirms a particular assumption, is irrelevant to any assumption, or annihilates the whole assumption-ground, of one audience may have been formulated to deny a particular assumption, be relevant to some assumption, or harmonize with the whole assumption-ground, of another audience. It is a common occurrence today for an out-group audience to monitor accidentally propositions originally directed towards an in-group audience. The academic world today is composed of specialized sub-worlds (disciplines) that are growing increasingly distinct both from each other and from the common-sense world (Berger and Luckmann, 1966), but that are also attempting to translate their internally generated propositions both to other disciplines and to the common-sense world. An audience that encounters one of these interdisciplinized or popularized propositions is likely to find it non-interesting because this proposition had not been specifically designed to take the assumptions of this new audience into account.

2. Complicating social factors

If an audience will find interesting any proposition that attacks the assumption they hold about its ic, then presumably all one would have to do to assert an interesting

22

proposition is, first, to specify what the audience assumption about any ic is, and, second, to come up with a proposition that refutes it. Unfortunately, whereas it is usually easy to come up with a proposition that refutes an audience assumption (one need simply refer to the foregoing index of interesting propositions); it is usually difficult to specify precisely what this potentially deniable audience assumption is.

Specifying an audience assumption about a ic is usually difficult because this assumption is not necessarily a unitary thing. Since Marx, we have been aware that any division within the social base of theoretical assumption-ground may cause a division within the theoretical assumption-ground itself. As an audience is often segmented along various social lines, the assumption about a ic held by one audience segment is likely to be at variance with the assumption about that ic held by another audience segment. In order to clarify the difficulties involved in specifying an audience assumption, let us consider a few of the most important audience segments whose assumptions must be taken into account by anyone who wants to assert a proposition that all members of his intended audience will find interesting.

The fundamental division in the social structure of an audience is between those who hold the common-sense assumption about a particular ic and those whose assumption about the ic is conditioned by their intellectual specialty or discipline (Berger and Luckmann, 1966). This is the division between the laymen who have "conventional wisdom" about the ic on the one side and the experts who have "esoteric knowledge" about the ic on the other. Within each of these two realms, further sub-divisions may occur, making it still more difficult to specify all of the audience assumptions, and consequently to create propositions that will be found universally interesting.

The assumptions about a ic held by both laymen and experts may be too diverse or too amorphous for any proposition about this ic to be found universally interesting. Variations in laymen's assumptions about the ic may be along the lines of the usual sociological categories — age, sex, class, etc. — or some more subtle sociological categories. Variations in experts' assumptions about the ic are usually along the lines of their membership in a particular discipline or in one of the schools of thought that are contending for power within that discipline. It will not be found easy to say something interesting about a ic on which there is no lay or expert consensus of assumptions. It is hard to deny what seems to be the case if there is no consensus about what seems to be the case.

23

Lay and expert assumptions about a ic may not only vary over social space, but also change over time. Since the consensus of assumptions in the past is usually considered to be greater than the consensus of assumptions in the present, those who wish to assert interesting propositions often try to refute what they call the "traditional view" of the ic. But in practice the traditional assumption past usually proves to be as hard to specify as the contemporary assumption.

Furthermore, what laymen and experts assume to be true about a ic has not only changed from the past, but is in the process of changing for the future. It is especially the younger generation who begin to take for granted a new assumption about a ic that differs from the taken-for-granted assumption of the older generation. This new assumption that is becoming increasingly accepted by the young may be called the vanguard assumption.3

If the main problems of asserting propositions that will be found interesting to either all laymen or all experts involve the fact that their baseline assumptions are often formless or floating, the main problem of asserting propositions that will be found interesting to both laymen and experts involves the fact that their separate baseline assumptions are often incommensurate.

Although it has now become generally recognized that the realms of the various intellectual specialties have split off from the common-sense world (Berger and Luckmann, 1966), the implication of this fact for the generation of propositions has not been made explicit. On the phenomenological level, this split between Conventional Wisdom and Esoteric Knowledge occurred when propositions were asserted that denied the assumptions of the common-sense world. Intellectual specialties were formed when various groups of self-styled experts began to accept those propositions that had refuted the assumptions of laymen. As an intellectual specialty developed, what began merely as a proposition that refuted a taken-for-granted assumption of the common-sense world now became a taken-for-granted assumption in its own right. When an intellectual specialty reached maturity — and this is the important point — all propositions generated within it are referred back not to the old baseline of the taken-for-granted assumption of the common-sense world, but to the new baseline of the taken-for-granted assumption of the intellectual specialty itself. In other words, an intellectual specialty, which began in a dialectical relationship with an assumption of the common-sense world, evolves and progresses by means of an internal dialectic with its own basic assumption.

24

Anyone who wishes to assert a proposition that will be found interesting by laymen as well as experts must deal with the dilemma of this double dialectic. On the one hand, his proposition will interest experts only if it denies the ground-assumption of their discipline. On the other hand, his proposition will interest laymen only if it denies a ground-assumption of the common-sense world. But since the ground-assumption of experts is already a denial of a ground-assumption of laymen, he will find that any proposition that interests experts (because it denies their ground-assumption) will not interest laymen (because it affirms their ground-assumption), and vice versa. What will be interesting to the one will be obvious to the other.

In the academic world, a person usually resolves this dilemma by grasping for one horn while ignoring the other, by restricting the potential audience who will consider his proposition to his fellow experts while not worrying about the opinion of laymen. He will usually publish his proposition in a specialized journal or technical text, where it will be scrutinized only by his colleagues who hold the very ground-assumption he wishes to attack. But note that the propositions of these specialized journals and technical texts that are found interesting by their professional readers are actually of the form: What everybody, except experts on the subject, think is true is in fact true.

No one will recognize that the proposition is of this form until the proposition is brought to the attention of non-experts. However, the more a person's proposition is found interesting by the experts of his field, the more he will be tempted to bring it to the attention of these non-experts. Should he be foolish enough to reveal the proposition that interested his colleagues to his non-professional friends, he will usually find that they are not impressed. Should he be even more foolish enough to disseminate this proposition to a wider public through popularizing it in newspapers and magazines, he will succeed only in convincing more people of the poverty of his discipline.

In sum, the fact that the baseline assumptions of intellectual specialties and the baseline assumptions of the common-sense world are incommensurate is responsible for the fact that propositions that had had good receptions in the former usually get poor receptions in the latter. Those who attempt to popularize propositions that experts had found interesting often must resort to jargon in order to obscure the fundamental lack of inter-translatability between the universe of discourse of the intellectual specialty and the universe of discourse of the common-sense world. They are aware, intuitively if not consciously, that the interestingness of an expert's proposition, like the poetry of a foreign author, is what gets lost in translation.4

25

 3. Uncomplicating social factors

Considering all of the assumptions of all of the various audience segments that a proposition must react against in order to be considered interesting, it is a wonder that anyone has ever asserted a proposition that attracted widespread interest. But the fact that some social theorists do occasionally utter propositions that are generally found interesting should alert us to the possibility that the problem of generating interesting propositions is not so complex as it first appears.

Although there is a diversity of audience segments, on a certain level of abstraction there is only a duality of audience assumptions. Therefore, one technique a person can use to simplify the assumptions of his audience is to raise the level of abstraction at which he considers them. The higher the level of abstraction at which his proposition attacks the assumptions of his audience, the more the assumptions of his audience will run together. Eventually, as in The Index of the Interesting, he will be able to reach that level of abstraction at which there are only two audience assumptions about a ic possible. There may be many segments to his audience, but, at a certain level of abstraction, each segment must assume either 'X' or 'non-X' about a particular ic, and therefore each segment will find interesting either a proposition that asserts 'non-X' against its assumption of 'X' or a proposition that asserts 'X' against its assumption of 'non-X'. For example, although audience segments may differ as to the degree each thinks a certain phenomenon is generalizable, the social theorist who raises the level of abstraction at which the phenomenon is defined can divide all his audience segments into two groups: those who think this abstractly defined phenomenon is generalizable at all, and those who think this abstractly defined phenomenon is merely local. Having categorized his audience segments in this way, he can now interest the former group of audience segments by asserting the phenomenon is actually local or he can interest the latter group of audience segments by asserting the phenomenon is actually generalizable. By directing his proposition towards the assumption of those audience segments who form the majority, or at least the majority of those whose opinion is significant to him, the social theorist will find that his proposition will elicit wide, if not universal, interest.

If he still wants to try for universal, rather than merely majority, interest, the social theorist has another means at his disposal. Having narrowed the number of assumptions of the segments of his audience down to two, he may wish to reduce this duality of assumptions still further. He may wish to cohere the assumption-ground of all his audience segments into a unity, to bring together his many adversaries into a single opponent — "the enemy." The rhetorical technique of integrating all of the assumptions

26

that are to be refuted into the single (wrong) assumption of the 'other side' may be called consensus creation.

Consensus creation is an artful task that involves three steps. First, the social theorist articulates lack of consensus into dissension either generally ("Half think 'X' and half think 'non-X'.") or along the lines of specific sociological categories ("The lower classes think 'X', whereas the upper classes think 'non-X'.") or of categories appropriate to an intellectual specialty ("The Structural-Functionalists think 'X'; the Symbolic-Interactionists think 'non-X'.") Second, he claims this apparent dissension is actually a consensus at a higher level. ("But both these groups are actually saying the same thing: 'Y'.") Finally, having created this higher consensus of assumptions, he is now ready to deny it. ("However, they are both wrong. What really is the case is 'non-Y'.")

All segments of the social theorists' audience will now find his proposition interesting because it refutes the basic assumption shared by all of them (which basic assumption they themselves may not have known they all fundamentally assumed until he pointed out to them that they did). Convincing one's audience that they fundamentally hold a particular assumption about a ic, however, takes somewhat more than rhetorical skill. It also takes some knowledge of what assumptions about the ic the audience does actually hold. Should the assumption that a social theorist tries to convince his audience that they actually hold be too discrepant from the assumption they do actually hold, his audience will accuse him of setting up a straw man — an assumption that is easily blown over because no flesh and blood person ever actually held it — certainly no member of his audience.

In either the common-sense world or the world of his intellectual specialty, a social theorist may attempt to create a potentially refutable assumption around the Traditional Assumption, the Contemporary Assumption, or the Vanguard Assumption. For all three, this temporally-specific form of consensus creation involves selecting as targets a few representative writers — past, present, or prophetic — showing them all to be saying essentially the same thing about a particular ic, and claiming that their mutual position on this ic embodies the Refutandum — the basic assumption of the time in all its various manifestations that the social theorist is going to attempt to refute. In the case of sociology, for instance, a few sociologists must be shown to represent not merely a sociological tradition, but the sociological tradition; not merely a position of some sociologists today, but the present position of sociologists; not merely a possible trend in sociology, but the coming trend in sociology. If a social theorist can also convince his

27

audience that what these representative writers assume about a ic is in fact what his audience themselves assume about the ic — only less articulately — then he has set the stage on which the battle for his audience's attention will take place. He is now ready to launch an attack against his audience's assumption in order to capture and to hold their interest. His probability of success in this endeavor is augmented by the fact that he well knows the weakness in the rampart of his audience's assumption, for — being the one who articulated this assumption for his audience — he himself has had a hand at its construction.

Whereas the logical steps that create conviction end with Q. E. D. (Quod Erat Demonstrandum!), the rhetorical steps that incubate interest end with Q. E. R. (Quod Erat Refutandum!).

It is much harder for a social theorist to generate a proposition that will be found interesting in both the common-sense world and the world of his intellectual specialty, and therefore such a task is usually not attempted. However, there are a few occasions in which it will be worth his while to attempt to make a proposition evoke this ecumenical interest.

Laymen and experts will find the same proposition interesting when their assumptions about its ic happen to line up; but, for reasons that we have seen, their assumptions about ics are usually out-of-phase. Nevertheless, the assumptions of laymen and experts do occasionally get into phase, for, while the assumptions of both are evolving in the dialectical manner described above, the assumptions of the former are changing more slowly than the assumptions of the latter and sometimes fall two stages behind. When this occurs, a proposition of general interest becomes possible.

Another reason it is difficult for a social theorist to assert a proposition that will interest laymen as well as experts is that the ics on which experts have assumptions are often so obscure that laymen have no assumptions about these ics at all. (This is even more the case in the natural sciences.) The social theorist, however, can make laymen interested in expert propositions about these esoteric ics if he can first make them feel the necessity and value of having an assumption — any assumption — about these ics. He can make a ic thus significant to laymen — i.e. make it a subject of their on-going theoretical activity — by first demonstrating its concrete effect on their on-going practical activity. Importance is the mother of Interest even if Refutation is the father.

4. Further research into the implications of interesting propositions

28

I wish to re-emphasize the fact that I did not intend for The Index of the Interesting to be definitive. Both the collection and the categorization of interesting propositions need further refinement.

A more sophisticated method of identifying interesting propositions should be developed. In the case of sociology, it might be fruitful to take a survey of sociologists in which they would be asked to "Name your five favorite sociological propositions." Or one might analyze those sociological propositions chosen for highlighting in the American Sociologist in order to see what the staff of the official organ of the profession considers interesting. Sociological propositions that aroused general interest may also be found in those articles chosen for reprinting either in the Bobbs-Merrill Reprint Series or in various popular texts of selected readings.

A more formal category system of interesting propositions should also be developed. It could be modeled along the lines of those category systems of all possible propositions (judgements) developed by Aristotle in his Organon, Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason, Hegel in his Logic, or some more recent system. Furthermore, specifying its sub-categories on lower levels of abstraction would increase the usefulness of the category system.

The reader may wish to adapt the category system of interesting propositions for personal use. He may do this informally by attempting to locate in The Index of the Interesting those social theories that he himself has always found appealing. Those that are easily located in the category system will provide him with subjectively relevant knowledge of the general types of social theories that he himself finds interesting. Those that are not easily located in the category system will provide him with objectively relevant knowledge of how, in order to include them, The Index of the Interesting ought to be revised or extended.

Stimulating an audience's interest in a particular proposition is, as we have seen, in a matter of rhetoric. Consequently, we might obtain additional insight into the rhetorical strategies that are used to arouse an audience's interest by studying both classical and modern treatises on the art and practice of rhetoric.

It would also be useful to discover the psychological basis of the fact that some theories attract interest whereas others do not. Gestalt Psychology is likely to be the most fruitful approach to the psychological explanation of interesting theories. Its highly developed

29

analysis of how objects that arouse perceptive interest involve figures that stand out against their backgrounds provides an intriguing parallel with the foregoing analysis of how propositions that arouse cognitive interest involve assertions that run counter to their assumption-grounds.

There are other things besides propositions that can attract interest, like paintings and people. Perhaps we could come to understand their drawing power as well if we also looked at them in terms of anticipation and surprise. We might then find that paintings are interesting insofar as their form or content contravenes accepted aesthetic rules, while people are interesting insofar as their character or behavior contradicts status and role expectations. Before any conclusions can be drawn, however, the extent and manner of these deviations from the norm must be made more explicit.

Finally, further research on interesting propositions in the social (and natural) sciences can help us to learn more about the theoretical structure of the common-sense world. If it is true that those propositions that are found interesting are those that deny various aspects of this conventional structure, then we can gain understanding of the nature of this conventional structure indirectly by studying those interesting propositions that deny it. Moreover, we can gain understanding of the variations in this conventional structure also indirectly by studying those propositions that interest individuals at some social locations but do not interest individuals at other social locations. Regardless of the truth of a proposition, then, the mere fact that someone finds it interesting indicates that there is much we can learn from it.

5. Implications of interesting propositions for further research

The common critique of most contemporary social and especially sociological research is that it is dull, that it says what everybody knows or what nobody cares about. It is this defect in the way the social sciences are generally practiced today — perhaps more than any other single reason — that is responsible for the relatively low status of their disciplines, for the relatively low ability they have to attract superior students, for the relatively low enthusiasm they arouse in the public and even in their own practitioners. In order to discover the cause of their present lethargy and to propose a cure I will try to bring out the implications for social and especially sociological research of the foregoing discussion of what makes a theoretical proposition interesting. Hopefully, once social scientists become more aware of the deficiency of their disciplines, they will be inspired to transform old procedures that have made them vapid into new procedures that will make them vital.

30

We have seen that the criterion that distinguishes an interesting proposition from a non-interesting proposition is that the former, unlike the latter, denies a specific assumption of its audience. Analysis of all books and articles that have left their mark on the social sciences will show, I believe, that they satisfy this criterion in the various ways enumerated in The Index of the Interesting. If this is the case, then, the present languor of the social sciences is due directly to the fact that social scientists do not attempt to satisfy this criterion in their own research consistently. What success their own research has in interesting others comes only from the fact that they satisfy this criterion inadvertently. Those social scientists who are considered the most interesting today are those who actually apply this criterion to their own research intuitively. The point of this paper, however, is to show that the social sciences as a whole could be much improved if all students of social life were taught to evaluate their own research according to this criterion consciously.

Glaser and Strauss (1967) have astutely observed that the anemic state of modern sociology in particular stems largely from the fact that most courses and textbooks on sociological methods pay too much attention to the confirmation of theories and not enough attention to the generation of theories. But Glaser and Strauss have not specified the remedy for this deficiency precisely enough. What is needed is not more social theories, but more interesting social theories. The student of social life needs to know not merely how to generate a theory from a body of data; he needs to know how to generate a theory from a body of data that will be found interesting.

Glaser and Strauss feel that the prerequisite for generating a theory is an intense familiarity with the data. But I would add that the prerequisite for generating an interesting theory is an intense familiarity with previous audience assumptions about the data as well. To be found interesting, a theory must be played off against what was previously assumed about the phenomenon in question. An audience will not find interesting just any theory about mental hospitals; they will find interesting only those theories about mental hospitals that clash with their previous stereotypes of mental hospitals. Therefore, the social researcher who wants to be certain that he will produce an interesting theory about his subject must first familiarize himself with what his audience already assumes to be true about his subject, before he can even begin to generate a proposition that, in denying their assumption, will attract their attention.5

More generally, courses and texts on methods in the social sciences should teach their students to see that the construction of influential social theories does not take place in

31

an intellectual vacuum. The present logical approach to theory construction should be supplemented by an approach to theory construction that is not only phenomenological as we have seen, but also ecological, for it is not the inner development of a theory that makes it interesting, but its outer relation to the assumption of its audience. It will not do merely to inform the student of the ways in which his theory must be induced from the data or deduced from more abstract principles. The student must also be made to recognize that his own theory about a ic comes into being in an environment in which it will have to compete for the scarce resources of his audience's attention and allegiance with at least one other theory. This other theory — which got there first — consists of what the audience thinks it already knows (i.e. assumes to be true) about a given body of data.6 Theory construction, in other words, should not be treated as an independent logical or empirical enterprise separate from, and unrelated to, what the audience already knows about a given body of data, for they will consider a new theory interesting — pay attention to what it proposes — only if it reacts against the baseline of what they previously presumed.

In short, the student should learn that he must always take into account the assumption of his audience about a ic before asserting his own theory about this ic. The more clearly he can specify his audience's assumption, the more strikingly he will be able to attack it. This denial of a clearly understood audience assumption is the essence of the interesting. It is what separates enduring research from ephemeral research. Those disciplines that make this conscious awareness of audience assumptions a standard part of their methodological procedures will raise the proportion of interesting propositions relative to non-interesting propositions in circulation within their discipline, will consequently increase the Interesting Quotient (I.Q) of their discipline relative to the Interesting Quotient of other disciplines, and will therefore reap the benefits that accrue to a high status intellectual enterprise that is capable of enthusing both the public and its own practitioners.

6. The interesting and the academic

The analysis of the interesting elaborated here also has repercussions on the non-research activities of social (and other) scientists, particularly in the areas of course presentation and curriculum development.

Courses are usually laid out on a model of increasing structured differentiation. First, a general theory regarding some subject matter is presented in the introductory lectures. Then, this general theoretical framework is applied to specific categories or instances of

32

the subject matter in the rest of the course. Finally, in the concluding lectures, this general theory is summarized with its limitations and potentials pointed out. But this structural approach to course presentation often fails to grasp the student's interest because it does not specifically concern itself with what the student finds interesting. As in the case of theory construction, too much concern with the inner processes of the subject matter and too little concern with the audience's evolving view of the subject matter will alienate the one from the other.

A phenomenological-ontological approach to course presentation, however, would overcome this deficiency of the structural approach, for it would be concerned at all times with the evolution of the student's assumptions about the subject matter. With this approach, a course would begin by articulating the student's common-sense assumptions about the subject matter, would continue by refuting these lay assumptions and replacing them with expert propositions, and would conclude by rapidly recapitulating, and thus manifesting for the student, the process by which his original naive view of the subject matter was transformed into a new sophisticated view of the subject matter. Such a course demands from the teacher not merely knowledge of the goal to which he wants to draw his students, but also knowledge of their starting point — where his students were originally at. Any course whose on-going development parallels the natural progression of the student's mind from start to finish should have no difficulty in eliciting and sustaining their interest.

The curriculum as a whole should also be synchronized with the mental development of the student. The fact that little attention is paid to the evolving assumptions of students in most curricula today is responsible for the fact that students often feel their education lacks relevance. Since naive student assumptions about a subject matter are most ignored at the introductory level, beginning students are particularly prone to finding introductory courses (and texts) dull. If a person's interest is aroused only when he encounters something unexpected, then he will necessarily find an introductory course to be dull insofar as it does not deny his expectations. Perhaps the only unexpected feature of most Introductory courses, their only redeeming feature that arouses what little interest the student has, is their denial of his assumption that some complex subject matter, like social life, is unordered.

Unfortunately, the particular kind of order that most Introductory courses impose on their subject matter consists merely of the Classic Statements of the field. Although these Classic Statements had interested previous generations of experts because they had denied their assumptions, these Classic Statements will fail to arouse present

33

student interest insofar as students today do not hold the same assumptions about the subject matter as did the experts of the previous generations.

Nevertheless, introductory courses (and texts) do perform an indispensable function in the curriculum of the discipline as a whole, for they set up the pre-conditions necessary for students to find advanced courses (and texts) interesting. Introductory courses engender those expectations about the subject matter that the propositions put forth in advanced courses are specifically designed to deny. Since the dialectical process of the interesting can occur only after specific assumptions about a subject have been formed, students usually find advanced courses to be more interesting than introductory courses. This is not to say that introductory courses — even if they must be less interesting than advanced courses — must be as uninteresting as they often are. They could be made more interesting to the beginning student if they attempted to show him in detail how the Classic Statements of the discipline actually do refute many of the assumptions about the subject matter that he has acquired merely by being socialized into the common-sense world of the outside society in which he grew up.

Very recently, in some parts of the academy, there has been a reaction against excessive concentration on the sophisticated propositions of experts. But this reaction seems to be turning into an excessive concentration on the naive assumptions of students. Both extremes are to be avoided if student interest is to be maintained. In the past, student interest in a subject was often inhibited by too much attention to the latest conclusions of experts and too little attention to the original assumptions of students. In the future, it looks as though student interest in a subject may be inhibited by too much attention to the original assumptions of students and too little attention to the latest conclusions of experts. Students will then be as bored with having their naive views left undisturbed as they were with having their naive views ignored. In either case, that transcendence of original assumptions that is intrinsic to the interesting does not occur. What is needed is a pedagogical approach that takes into account both the student's naive view of the subject matter as its beginning and the expert's sophisticated view of the subject matter as its end, and methodically leads the student from one to the other. Only in this way will the term academic cease to be synonymous with irrelevant.

7. The systematization of the interesting?

In trying to construct The Index of the Interesting, I had hoped to make it as systematic as possible. However, as I proceeded in this attempt, I discovered — to my dismay — that the more systematic I tried to make it, the less interesting it became. Rather than

34

continue to spin out my system at the increasing cost of decreasing interest, I decided that my dilemma itself might serve as the basis for some reflections on the relation between the interesting and the systematic.

At this critical point, I was proceeding in the following way. From my file of interesting propositions, I had taken one that I had not previously classified: "Robert Merton's assertion in Puritanism, Pietism, and Science that fundamentalist Protestantism and science, which were considered at the time he wrote to have developed from two completely different psycho-value complexes, in fact developed from the same psycho-value complex." From this, I induced its logical category — (xiii). Evolution — and its general type — (xiii)a "What seem to be phenomena that evolved out of completely different sources are in reality phenomena that evolved out of the same source.

According to my procedure for systematically elaborating my thesis — which had worked well enough in previous cases — the logical opposite of a general type of interesting proposition should also be a general type of interesting proposition. But here the trouble started. I could find no concrete example of supposedly interesting Type (xiii)b propositions: What seem to be phenomena that evolved out of the same source are in reality phenomena that evolved out of completely different sources. I found myself attempting to force several recalcitrant social theories into this mould. Noting that the results were uninspired and plainly artificial, I eventually gave up and decided not to extend my thesis into this new category at all, even though I was certain there was a good example of Type (xiii)b propositions somewhere and even though I hated to lose my Merton example of Type (xiii)a propositions, which was such an excellent illustration of the hermeneutic power of my thesis.

Let me try to abstract from my particular difficulty the general difficulty that all theorists must confront when they try to be both interesting and systematic. I will take the simplest case. A theorist makes an interesting assertion about phenomenon (a). His assertion is interesting because it counters his audience's previous belief about phenomenon (a). He discovers his assertion is also interesting in regard to phenomenon (b) because it also counters his audience's previous belief about phenomenon (b). But then he finds that the two phenomena with which he has been concerned — phenomenon (a) and phenomenon (b) — have a logical relationship that, through its own internal process, engenders a third phenomenon (c) and a fourth phenomenon (d).

35

a b

a a c

b d b

Now, if the theorist wishes to be systematic, he must further apply his assertion to phenomenon (c) and phenomenon (d). But he has no guarantee that this systematic application of his assertion to phenomenon (c) and phenomenon (d) will still be interesting because his assertion may not counter his audience's previous beliefs about phenomenon (c) and phenomenon (d).

The great theorist, therefore, intuitively recognizing the potential decline of interest in his assertion as this assertion is applied to more and more phenomena, usually only implies these extensions, leaving it to his epigone to articulate his system and systematically fill in the vacant boxes. These less perceptive followers will apply their mentor's originally provocative assertion mechanically in the sense that they will not be attentive-as their mentor was — to the presuppositions about these new ics that their audience already holds.

Systems begin interestingly enough, but there is much logical and sociological necessity for them not to end that way. One must usually choose between being interesting and being systematic. One cannot easily be both.

8. Conclusion

Phenomenology, as the term is generally used and as I have used it here, is the study of (mere) appearances on the sensory level and, more importantly for my purpose, (mere) assumptions on the cognitive level. The emphasis is on the "mere", for to call a phenomenon phenomenological implies that beyond what people see or assume there is something more real. But the term phenomenology has another, larger, meaning — developed by Hegel and Husserl — that includes not merely the seductively false appearances and assumptions, but the whole movement of the mind away from them

36

towards the ontologically true. It is in this larger sense of the entire process that what I have tried to lay out in these pages is a Phenomenology of Sociology.

I have asserted that all social theories that are found interesting involve a certain movement of the mind of the audience who finds them so. These theories implicitly articulate the routinely taken-for-granted assumptions of the audience who finds them interesting, and then deny these presumptions in the name of some higher — or more fundamental — truth. Yet not only is sociology founded upon this phenomenological process, this phenomenological process is equally founded upon sociology, for the original assumptions of each segment of the audience — the starting points of this process — are differentially distributed over social space.

Therefore, in order to develop fully a field of inquiry that may be called The Sociology of the Interesting, the Phenomenology of Sociology, which studies the movement of the audience's mind from one accepted social theory to another, must be combined with the Sociology of Phenomenology, which studies the dissimilar baseline theories of diverse lay and professional audience segments from which this phenomenological process begins.

It is important to distinguish the Sociology of Knowledge from the Sociology of the Interesting. The former is essentially a study of beliefs and assumptions; the latter is essentially a study of the breakdown and build up of beliefs and the transformation of assumptions. To be sure, the Sociology of Knowledge has studied the historical succession of ideologies, but, in its classic form at least (Mannheim, 1936), it has studied belief-systems as though they were static phenomena; it has considered the historical succession of belief-systems as the relatively sudden replacement of one static ideology by another static ideology. The Sociology of the Interesting, on the other hand, has a much less static, much more dynamic orientation. It focuses on the exact point at which one belief-system is being transformed into another belief-system. It focuses on the exact point at which the hold of an old theoretical assumption on some individuals or groups has weakened enough for them to begin to find a new — contradictory — theoretical proposition interesting. And it is concerned with discovering the precise sociological and phenomenological mechanisms of change. All this, however, does not mean that the Sociology of Knowledge should be replaced by the Sociology of the Interesting. It does mean that the Sociology of Knowledge should be supplemented by the Sociology of the Interesting, for crucial aspects of our changing theoretical structures that are necessarily obscured from the perspective of the former will be more clearly revealed from the perspective of the latter.

37

The foregoing discussion of the interesting gives us a model of scientific revolutions quite different from the one given by Thomas Kuhn (1962). Kuhn maintains, roughly, that a concrete experience that is anomalous to a previous set of scientific assumptions and interpretative procedures (paradigms) motivates scientists to look for a new set of scientific assumptions and interpretative procedures (paradigms) that explains the anomalous experience better than the old. But to view most scientists as unwilling to make a major change in the accepted conceptual scheme until some concrete anomaly forces them to is to attribute to most scientists a conservatism and lack of personal ambition that surely cannot be that common a personality characteristic even among natural scientists let alone social scientists. In opposition to Kuhn, I would contend that sheer boredom with the old routinely accepted paradigm and desire to make a name for themselves would motivate many scientists to look for anomalies unexplainable by the old paradigm but explainable by a new one (preferably of their own devising), rather than merely wait for the anomalies to crop up by themselves. One can acquire more professional status by attaching one's reputation to a rising new paradigm than by being the handmaiden of a declining old paradigm. The best way to make a name for oneself in an intellectual discipline is to be interesting — denying the assumed while affirming the unanticipated.

Yet one must be careful not to go too far. There is a fine but definite line between asserting the surprising and asserting the shocking, between the interesting and the absurd. An interesting proposition, we saw, was one that denied the weakly held assumptions of its audience. But those who attempt to deny the strongly held assumptions of their audience will have their very sanity called into question.7 They will be accused of being lunatics; if scientists, they will be called crackpots. If the difference between the inspired and the insane is only in the degree of tenacity of the particular audience assumptions they choose to attack, it is perhaps for this reason that genius has always been considered close to madness.

In this essay, I have tried to put forward a new way of analyzing theoretical propositions. 1 believe it is as important to learn why a theory is found interesting by some audience as it is to ascertain the truth of its content or the logic of its form.

This essay, then, has been both a description and an exhortation. It has been a description insofar as I have tried to designate those factors that have made the writings of great theorists so interesting, It has been an exhortation insofar as 1 have urged my readers to become more aware of these factors in order to make their own writings more

38

interesting. I contend that the generation of interesting theories ought to be the object of as much attention as the verification of insipid ones. This report should be regarded as an introductory investigation of that residual category of 'genius' that separates the great theorists from the mediocre. So what? Who cares?

Notes
1 However, a person might find interesting a proposition that affirms one of his assumptions if this assumption has lately been strongly attacked by others. Those whose beliefs have been recently weakened welcome new supports for old suppositions. ("Just as I always thought!")

2 The quality of being imaginative, which interesting theorists are praised for possessing, consists less of their ability to imagine inventively something novel than of their ability to imagine empathetically what others consider to be traditional.

3 The Vanguard Assumption of the young is derived from a proposition that has attempted to refute the Contemporary Assumption of the old in the following way. Many propositions that the older generation had found interesting become transformed into assumptions that the younger generation find routine. Consequently, those propositions that have interested the older generation — i.e. those that have attempted to refute their own taken-for-granted assumptions — may no longer appeal to the younger generation because these propositions may no longer have a dialectical impact on the younger generation's own taken-for-granted assumptions. They have become the younger generation's taken-for-granted assumptions! Freudian insights, for instance, do not seem to arouse much interest in the young today because the young today already assume the sex drive to be a prime motivator of human behavior.

4 Jargon is the failure to translate a proposition from one universe of discourse to another. It retains the interestingness of a proposition by actually re-restricting its audience to those very experts who found it interesting in the first place, for jargon is a meaningful unit of discourse only in relation to the baseline assumption of an intellectual specialty.

5 Although it might be thought that the "review of the literature" section of research articles and books serves this function, in most cases it does not do so adequately. Most social researchers do not clearly understand that the purpose of their review of the literature is to articulate the assumptions of their audience, and not merely to fulfil a

39

rhetorical ritual. Nor do they clearly understand that the purpose of the rest of their research presentation is to increase our interest by refuting these assumptions, and not merely to "increase our knowledge" by confirming or ignoring them.

6 Should there be more than one other accepted theory about the ic or should it not be clear what this other accepted theory is, the student will also have to handle the preliminary problem, treated in a previous section, of cohering the various competitors of his own theory into a single rival, before he can even attempt to vanquish them. "Unite and conquer" is the motto of every successful social theorist.

7 More precisely: Up to a certain point, the more strongly an audience holds an assumption, the more interesting they will find the proposition that denies it. But beyond this point, the more strongly an audience holds an assumption, the more insane they will consider anyone who attempts to deny it. Anyone who attempts to deny his audience's beliefs about natural and social phenomena past this point is, in effect, attacking his audience's very sanity. The audience, in this case, can save its own sanity only by accusing him of losing his.

  那很有意思！走向社会学的现象学和现象学的社会学
作者：Murray S. Davis Phil。SOC。科学。1（1971），309-344（修改）

摘要
问题：通常被认为有趣的理论与通常被认为无趣的理论有何不同？

答案：有趣的理论否认其受众的某些假设，而非有趣的理论肯定了其受众的某些假设。这个答案是通过对一些着名的社会理论，特别是社会学理论的考察得出的。该检验还产生了有趣和无意义理论可能采用的各种命题形式的系统指数。这种方法的生育率提出了一个新的领域，称为有趣的社会学，旨在补充知识社会学。这个新领域将以现象学为导向，因为它将集中于观众心灵从一种被接受的理论到另一种理论的运动。它将以社会学为导向，因为它将侧重于构成观众的各种社会学范畴的不同基线理论。除了它在解释理论的社会影响方面的价值之外，有趣的社会学可以有助于我们理解对现实的常识和科学观点。

第一部分：引言
人们一直认为理论家被认为是伟大的，因为他的理论是正确的，但这是错误的。一个理论家被认为是伟大的，不是因为他的理论是真实的，而是因为它们很有趣。那些仔细而详尽地验证琐碎理论的人很快就会被遗忘，而那些轻率和方便地验证有趣理论的人会被长久记住。事实上，一个理论的真实性与它的影响几乎没有关系，因为一个理论可以继续被发现有趣，即使它的真相是有争议的 - 甚至被驳斥！

1

既然这种激发兴趣的能力是伟大的必要条件，那么任何被认为是伟大的理论家的研究都必须首先考察为什么他们的理论被认为是有趣的 - 换句话说，理论师为什么值得研究。但在我们能够尝试这项初步任务之前，我们必须清楚地理解为什么有些理论被认为是有趣的而其他理论则不然 在这篇文章中，我将尝试确定理论被认为是有趣的（或者，极端的，令人着迷的）。

遵循当前教科书关于理论建构的所有禁令的学生，但在构建他们的理论时没有考虑其他标准，将会发现确实会变得乏味的工作。他们无可挑剔的构建理论将被其他人忽视 - 或者更确切地说，没有被注意到。但是，如果这些学生还考虑到下面详述的标准，将有趣的理论与无趣的理论区分开来，他们会发现他们的理论会使他们的读者真正坐下来注意。然后，他们的理论将在同事之间进行讨论，在期刊上进行审查，在论文中得到确认或否认，并教给学生作为他们职业进展的最新实例。

我将把我的研究局限于被认为有趣的社会理论，特别关注着名的社会学理论。然而，我建议，这里提出的分析的抽象程度足够高，它可以同样适用于社会科学所有领域的理论，甚至适用于自然科学理论。但是，以下讨论的这种概括必须等待进一步调查。

1.有趣的非命题

我将进一步限制本文，分析康德称之为“合成后验命题”的那些理论的有趣组成部分 - 断言指的是经验世界，而不仅仅是定义问题。但是，当然，这些命题并不是科学事业中唯一可能有趣的成分，尽管它们是最重要的。然而，空间禁止考虑各种类型的非命题，这些非命题也能引起人们的兴趣。因此，我不会处理（1）证实或否定假设的发现，（2）表明问题可以解决的方法的线索，（3）改进感知的美学描述，（4）类比，在熟悉的和（5）模型方面不熟悉，

2 

2.有趣和常规

有趣的是影响注意力的东西。Websters Third将有趣的定义为“吸引注意力”。这个问题自然而然地出现了：有趣的是它之前的注意力在哪里？

很难回答这个问题，因为根据定义，人们通常不会注意通常不关心的问题。但是，对于那些希望了解人类行为的人来说，回答这个问题非常重要，因为大多数人的大部分时间都生活在他们不关心的状态。哈罗德·加芬克尔（Harold Garfinkel，1967）将这种低关注或低意识状态称为“日常生活中常规化的被视为理所当然的世界”。根据定义，有趣的是，引起注意的不仅仅是非有趣的，也许前者可以用来表现后者。我将尝试使用有趣的内容来披露通常被认为是理所当然的东西。

如果一些观众认为有趣的东西的定义特征是它与他们日常生活中常规的理所当然的世界形成鲜明对比，那么一些观众认为有趣的理论的定义特征就是它与构成其日常生活理论结构的常规理所当然的命题相比，他们的注意力更加突出。换句话说，只有当一个新理论否认一个古老的真理（谚语，陈词滥调，格言，谚语，说法，普通等）时，它才会被注意到。（当然，理论被认为有趣的实际过程当然要复杂得多，因为观众分散为非专业群体和专业群体。

3.有趣的理论和实践

所有有趣的理论，至少所有有趣的社会理论，然后，攻击他们的观众的理所当然的世界。观众会认为任何特定的命题都值得说，只要它否定了他们常规假设的某些部分的真实性。如果它没有挑战，只是确认了他们被认为是理所当然的信仰之一，那么他们会在肯定其真实性的同时拒绝其价值来回应它。他们将宣称这个命题不需要陈述，因为它已经是他们理论计划的一部分：“当然。” “这很明显。” “每个人都知道。” “不言而喻。” 

3

被视为理所当然的世界不仅包括这个理论维度，还包括实际维度。只有在两个层面都有影响的情况下，理论才会被认为是真正有趣的。在后一个层面上，观众会发现一个理论只有在它否定了他们目前“正在进行的实践活动”（Garfinkel，1967）的重要性时才会感兴趣，并且坚持认为他们应该参与一些新的持续进行实际活动。如果一个理论的这种实际结果对于观众来说并不是立即显而易见的，那么他们会通过拒绝它的价值来回应它，直到有人能够具体地证明它的效用：“那又怎么样？” “谁在乎？” “何必？” “它有什么用？”

对社会研究的修辞结构的分析揭示了它如何在理论和实践层面上都显得有趣。关于这项研究的书籍和文章的标准形式如下：（1）作者通过回顾有关特定子传统的文献，阐述了他想象的观众的理所当然的假设（“它一直是想到......“）。（2）他引用了一个或多个否定传统假设的命题（“但这是假的......”）。（3）他花费了各种方法论设备证明的工作主体，旧的常规假设命题是错误的，而他所声称的新命题是正确的（“我们已经看到了......”）。（4）总之，

对社会研究的认知内容的分析更多地揭示了有趣的东西的本质，同样重要的是，不是。从理论上讲，值得研究一下被认为有趣的社会理论，因为它们揭示了他们正在攻击的常识每日外行人对世界的看法。实际上，值得研究那些被认为有趣的社会理论，以便我们可以学会自己主张有趣的理论。如果我们开始理解产生有趣理论的过程，我们将不必继续做到目前为止所做的事情 - 将有趣的理论留给灵感。

4.程序

为了发现使社会理论变得有趣的内容，我研究了许多被认为是有趣的社会学和特别是社会学的命题，希望能够将所有这些共同的利益分离出来，并将其归结为

4。

他们的分歧。由于我的目的主要是启发式的，所以我认为确定每个命题的准确程度是不必要或不可行的。在后面的部分中，1将提供一些关于如何将有趣命题的研究置于更严格的基础上的建议。出于本次调查的目的，我认为社会理论如果广泛流传就会引起人们的兴趣。这里的广泛流通意味着既包括那些在过去被认为有趣的社会理论，也包括那些最近被认为有趣的社会理论 - 即那些在空中的那些理论。（前者现在通常在入门课程中向学生讲授;后者在入门级以外的实质课程中讲授。

5.所有有趣命题的共同要素

我所研究的所有有趣的命题都被发现涉及现象学和本体论主题之间的看似和存在之间的根本区别。一个有趣的命题是首先阐述了关于世界某个特定部分看法的现象学假设，然后以真理的名义否定了这种现象学推定，即以更深刻，更真实，更真实的名义本体论标准。更准确地说，一个有趣的命题是首先尝试将其认可对手的本体论主张仅仅作为现象学的假装，然后以其自身对本体论优先权的主张来否定这种现象学假装。简而言之，一个有趣的命题总是否定一个被接受的命题。

6.有趣命题的种类

虽然发现所有有趣的命题在现象学和本体论之间具有相同的辩证关系，但发现它们在逻辑层面上是有区别的。各种有趣的命题分为12个逻辑类别，涉及单个现象的表征或多个现象之间的关系。这12个逻辑类别构成了有趣的指数。

第二部分：有趣的指数
5 

A - 单一现象的特征

（i）组织

a。似乎是一种混乱（非结构化）现象，实际上是一种有组织的（有组织的）现象。

示例：Ferdinand Tonnies在社区和社会中断言，在他写作多种多样且不确定的时候，所有社会中人们之间的关系都被认为是，实际上可以围绕两种主要类型（Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft）进行组织。

湾 似乎是有组织的（有组织的）现象实际上是一种混乱（非结构化）现象。

例子：卡尔·马克思在“资本论”中断言，资产阶级社会的经济过程在他写作时被认为是以一种方式组织的，实际上并没有以这种方式组织（而是以另一种方式组织）。

评论：一个较年轻的成熟学科的主旨是发展类型（i）a的组织命题。也许社会学中最基本的例子是奥古斯特·康普特（Auguste Compte）断言，社会现象本身在他写作非结构化（与自然现象不同）时被认为确实具有可以被科学所掌握的连贯结构。一个学科的主要子领域也开始于一个组织对一个被认为是无组织的特定社会现象的主张。因此，古斯塔夫·勒邦（Gustave LeBon）开始建立集体行为领域时，他设法构建了一些看似混乱的人群。组织命题通常缩写为概念。以库利为例，

塔尔科特帕森斯当然是社会理论和社会过程中最着名的生活组织者，他的名声主要来自于类型（i）a的命题。在他早期的作品（社会行动的结构）中，他断言四位二十世纪早期的社会理论家（马歇尔，涂尔干，帕累托和韦伯）在他写作时被认为是在处理完全不同的社会现象。完全不同的方式，实际上所有人都说同一般的社会

6 基本相同

现象。在他后来的工作（经济与社会）中，他声称四个主要的社会机构（家庭，文化，政治和经济）在他写作时彼此相对不协调，实际上都是严格的融入一个连贯的社会系统。

需要复兴的旧的停滞不前的学科的主旨是制定类型（i）b的解散或批判命题。每个混乱的命题批评了先前接受的组织命题的充分性（尽管几乎总是要求替换新的组织命题，而不仅仅是声称这种现象完全无法构建）。成功企图破坏公认组织的典型例子包括沃德对社会达尔文主义的批判和米德对沃森行为主义的批判。最近对现代社会学中被接受的组织的批评涉及类型（i）b命题，包括Denis Wrong对其模型的攻击，Harold Garfinkel对其方法的攻击，以及Alvin Gouldner对其政治的攻击。

请注意，不仅任何组织命题都很有趣：只有那些组织现象似乎过于复杂或混乱才能被排序的人。并不只是任何批评命题都很有趣：只有那些批评以前被普遍接受的现象组织的人。

（ii）组成

a。似乎是各种各样的异质现象实际上是由单个元素组成的。

例如：西格蒙德·弗洛伊德在他的文集中断言儿童，原始人，神经病学家和成年人在人群中的行为，以及梦想，笑话，以及舌头和笔的滑动，这些在他写作时都被认为是无关联的以任何方式彼此，实际上是相同的本能驱动的所有各种表现形式

湾 似乎是单一现象的东西实际上是由各种不同的元素组成的。

例如：马克斯·韦伯在“经济与社会”中断言，在他写作单片时所考虑的分层制度实际上是由经济阶级，地位声望和政治权力三个独立变量组成的。

7

评论：许多自然科学家和社会科学家通过指出自然或社会现象的出现是一种幻觉以及这种现象真正由其表面之下的谎言构成了声誉。当这些理论家断言这种现象的基本性质（深度结构）与表面印象相矛盾时，他们深刻的洞察力被认为特别有趣，例如，表格看似连续的外观与它的离散分子相矛盾。实际组成。通常，这些科学家指出了一个单一的因素，这个因素是迄今为止看似异质现象的基础。在社会科学中，像马克思，尼采这样的单一主义理论家，麦克卢汉已将大量看似多样化的社会现象减少到其经济，权力或交流成分。其他社会理论家已经观察到一些看似多样化的社会现象至少有一个共同的组成部分已经实现了不那么雄心勃勃，但仍然有趣的减少。因此，西梅尔在他的社会学中表明，“三元形式”以及与之相关的互动过程，都是三人家庭和三级社会的基础。

当理论家设法区分构成先前认为是单一的现象的若干因素时，会出现相反类型的有趣命题（ii）b。Talcott Parsons在分析和综合方面尝试过，他在社会系统中构建了一个类型（ii）b命题，当时他断言Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft，当时他认为每个人都认为是一个不可分割的现象，实际上由几个独立的（模式）变量组成。

Paul Lazarsfeld和Allan Barton（1955）在经验社会学研究中区分了两种类型的构成命题。那些产生类型（ii）的研究方法是一种他们称之为“减少”的命题。减少包括简化复杂分类（索引）的方法。那些产生类型（ii）b命题的研究方法他们称之为“子结构”。子构建包括详细分类（类型）的方法。

在今天的每一种社会科学中，主要的思想流派都经常以大陆结构主义或英国分析哲学为蓝本。那些来自大陆结构主义的学派试图通过制定旨在提出第（ii）a类命题的方法程序来使其产出变得有趣。那些来自英国分析哲学的学派试图通过开发旨在提出类型（ii）b的命题的方法论程序来使他们的输出变得有趣。

8

更一般地说，我们可以说那些主张类型（ii）命题的人是柏拉图式传统的门徒，其中通过在明显复杂的情况下找到简单性来产生有趣的命题; 那些主张类型（ii）b命题的人是亚里士多德传统的门徒，其中通过发现显然简单的复杂性来产生有趣的命题。

（iii）抽象

a。似乎是一种个体现象实际上是一种整体现象。

例如：Emile Durkheim在自杀中断言自杀是在他写作个人行为特征的时候考虑的，实际上（更关键的）是一个社会特征的过程。

湾 似乎是一种整体现象实际上是一种个体现象。

例如：西格蒙德·弗洛伊德在“战争与死亡时代的思想”中断言战争在他写作社会现象时被认为是事实上（更重要的）是一种心理现象。

评论：类型（iii）的整体命题断言，似乎个人的财产实际上是个人所属的某些整体的财产。在社会科学中，使用类型（iii）将命题作为吸引观众注意力的技术通常被称为“社会化”或“社会学帝国主义”。随着自杀，

类型（iii）b的特殊命题断言，似乎整体的属性实际上是构成整体的个体的财产。在社会科学中，使用类型（iii）b命题作为吸引观众注意力的技术通常被称为“心理化”或“心理还原论”。当然，弗洛伊德是社会现象的经典心理学家，他在许多其他例子中发现了诸如图腾和禁忌等看似社会现象的本能根源。最近，新发现的“地域性”的个体本能（Lorenz，Ardrey）解释了各国对土地发动战争的看似社会事实。

9

（值得注意的是，Vilfredo Pareto将各种社会现象减少到他们的心理根源 - “残余” - 对美国的兴趣远远低于弗洛伊德。尽管帕累托首先写了这些动词，但他的作品在弗洛伊德和弗洛伊德之后最后跨越了海洋。其他人已经成功地改变了美国的假设基础和习惯的美国人，期望许多社会现象会产生心理基础。然而，他认为更为次要的帕累托思想的其他领域成功地吸引了更多的兴趣。）

最近在社会科学中出现了第三种抽象命题。它试图通过否定类型（iii）a和类型（iii）b命题的假设来引起观众的兴趣。这种类型的命题断言，人类现象的真实轨迹既不是个人层面，也不是社会层面，而是一些中间的社会心理层面。然而，只有当这种现象在心理学和社会学上得到解释时，对这种现象的社会心理学解释才会有趣，并且支持这些解释的人之间的争论变得越来越激烈。

（iv）概括

a。实际上似乎是一种局部现象是一种普遍现象。

例如：卡尔曼海姆在意识形态和Uia中的断言，认为思想过程的思想局限和歪曲，在他写作只影响资产阶级时所考虑的，实际上影响了所有的社会阶级。

湾 看似普遍的现象实际上是一种局部现象。

例如：布罗尼斯瓦夫·马林诺斯基（Bronislaw Malinowski）在“野蛮社会中的性与压抑”（Sex and Repression in Savage Society）中断言，俄狄浦斯情结（Oedipus complex）在他写作人类普遍时被认为是实际上并不存在于所有社会中。

评论：推广命题和本地化命题是现代社会科学研究中最常见的两种命题。事实上，今天社会科学方法论的主要目标似乎是建立严格的程序，以确定一些关于社会生活的主张可以概括的确切程度。

10

尽管过去伟大的社会理论家倾向于断言普遍存在的关于人类生活的一些真理，但是，如民族方法论和调查研究以及英美人类学这样的不同社会学派的共同趋势是本地化断言。并强调小组变异。在过去，人们会试图表明某些行为特征适用于所有人类; 在目前，试图表明一些行为特征适用于某些群体和部落，但不适用于其他群体和部落。

当一个理论家声称每个人都知道某个社会类别的特征也是另一个不存在其存在的社会范畴的特征时，理论家会做出一个有趣的概括。例如，弗洛伊德试图表明，性冲动不仅对成年人的行为（这是相当明显的）有重大影响，而且对儿童的行为（不是那么明显）也有影响。

当一个理论家声称某些被认为是每个人的特征 - 属于人性的属性 - 只属于一个社会范畴而不属于其他社会时，他就会进行一个有趣的本地化。例如，爱德华·霍尔试图证明，文化间接触中的许多问题源于一个社会中的人们，他们相信所有其他社会中的人们都像空间特征一样具有相同的意义; 事实上，在不同的社会中，对空间维度的关键方面的解释差异很大。

（v）稳定

a。看似稳定不变的现象实际上是一种不稳定和不断变化的现象。

例子：卡尔·马克思在“资本论”中断言，资产阶级社会的社会组织在他写作永久性时被认为是实际上，它实际上将会突然发生巨大变化。

湾 看似不稳定和变化的现象实际上是一种稳定而不变的现象。

例如：Georg Simmel在冲突中断言任何冲突缠身的社会组织，在他写作处于转型边缘时被认为可能实际上能够无限期地继续存在（处于稳定的冲突状态） ）。

11

评论：正如一些命题是有趣的，因为它们在一些社会范畴空间中断言意外概括或缺乏对社会现象特征的概括，因此其他命题很有意思，因为它们表明意外的稳定或缺乏稳定的特征。一种跨时间的社会现象。类型（v）的命题属于历史社会学的范围，涉及证明社会现象的时间连续性或变化。

历史社会学的一个翼试图通过展示令人惊讶的不稳定性甚至看似稳定的社会现象的变化来构建类型（v）a的有趣命题。例如，新左派历史社会学家断言，在他们写作的时候被认为是基本价值共识的美国社会，实际上已经有很长的破坏历史，冲突，暴力，并且初期解体。在规模较小的范围内，Berger和Luckmann在“现实社会建构”中指出，所有持久的社会制度并不像人们想象的那样“自然地”存在，而是必须建立精细的维护机制来抵御对其稳定性的持续威胁。 。

历史社会学的另一翼试图通过展示看似不稳定的社会现象的令人惊讶的稳定性和甚至永久性来构建类型（v）b的有趣命题。除了齐美尔和“社会冲突的功能”之类的理论家刘易斯科瑟试图展示那些看似自我破坏的社会现象的过程实际上是那些帮助社会现象维持自身的过程，这个翼也包括那些原型像“新世代的冲突中的新弗洛伊德的刘易斯费尔和微观世界的新荣格菲利普斯莱特”这样的理论家，他们解释了看似暴力和破坏性的社会现象，例如学生对大学管理者的骚乱和集体反抗他们的领导人，

（vi）功能

a。似乎是一种无效地发挥作为实现目标的手段的现象，实际上是一种有效运作的现象。

例如：罗伯特·默顿在社会理论和社会结构方面的断言认为，当时他认为政治机器是一个效率低下的

12 

机构，用于获得社区目标，实际上是一个获得社区目标的有效机构。

湾 似乎是一种有效地发挥作为实现目的的手段的现象实际上是一种无效运作的现象。

例子：赫伯特马尔库塞在镇压宽容中的主张，即美国宽容传统，当时他认为这是一种促进解放社会目标的价值，实际上是一种阻碍解放社会目标的价值观。 。

评论：默顿对显性和潜在功能的讨论（1957）是专门设计用于产生有趣命题的方法论技术的经典陈述。他的方法类似于这里提出的方法，但仅限于一种有趣的命题（类型（vi））。

默顿告诉社会理论家以下列方式继续前进。鉴于社会理论家对某些社会现象的实际运作的“深入”洞察，他首先否认默顿所说的其显而易见的（即一般明显的）功能或功能障碍，然后揭示默顿称之为潜在的东西（即一般不明显）功能或功能障碍。虽然默顿没有具体说明，但他强烈暗示社会现象的潜在功能或功能障碍必须与其明显的功能障碍或功能相反。

类型（vi）一个命题具有保守的政治含义：一个人不应该试图改变一个明显有缺陷的社会制度，而这个制度实际上具有有用的后果。换句话说，社会理论家声称某个社会机构，其观众已被拒绝，实际上已经产生了后果，他的观众已经批准了这些后果。类型（vi）命题的流行例子是“巫医医生真正有效治愈他们的病人”和“疾病的民间疗法变得非常有效”。

类型（vi）b命题具有激进的政治含义：人们应该尝试改变一个看似成功的社会制度，而这个制度实际上具有破坏性后果。换句话说，社会理论家声称，他的观众已经批准的某个社会机构实际上有后果，他的观众已经不赞同这种后果。类型的最典型的例子（六）b命题是“监狱真

13 

转出罪犯”，“学校真的让孩子笨”和“精神病医院真是让人精神病。”

虽然没有必要的理论上的理由说明为什么这两种命题不应该以相同的频率出现，但默顿和他的追随者提出了更多的类型（vi）命题，而激进的社会学家提出了更多的类型（vi）b命题。 。

（vii）评估

a。看似不好的现象实际上是一种好现象。

例如：RD Laing在“体验的政治”中断言，精神分裂症在他写的时候被认为是一件坏事，实际上是一件好事。

湾 看似好的现象实际上是一种不好的现象。

例如：富有的尼采在“道德谱系”中的断言认为基督教道德在他写作好事时被认为是一件坏事。

评论：只有当理论家对一种现象的评价与观众对这种现象的评价不同时，才会发现评价命题很有趣。理论家可以通过两种方式对可接受的价值进行重新评估。

首先，他可以通过改变要评级的现象的指标（操作定义）来改变现象的评级。根据观众的评价，他可以选择现象的最佳或最差的特定方面来代表整个现象。如果他的听众习惯性地以最佳方式看待这种现象，那么他可以在最坏的情况下看待它，反之亦然。因此，如果一个社会理论家希望反对他的观众对美国社会的评价是伟大的还是可怕的，他只需要选择，作为他作为整体美国社会道德价值的指标，通常被认为是其方面的指标。糟糕（如污染，贫困，物质主义等）或其通常被认为是好的方面（如技术，平均收入，丰富的消费品，

14

其次，他可以通过改变被比较的道德测量来改变现象的评级。相对于一些好的或坏的标准，某些东西被判断为好或坏。改变比较标准，对现象的评价也可能发生变化。如果他的听众习惯性地相对于一个比较基线积极评估一个现象，那么他可以相对于另一个比较基线对其进行负面评估，反之亦然。社会现象的比较基线包括（1）同一逻辑类型的其他社会现象，（2）过去（近期或遥远）的相同社会现象，（3）社会现象的未来预测（短期或长期） ），以及（4）社会现象的一些正面或负面理想版本。因此，如果社会理论家希望反击他的观众

（请注意，所有关于整个美国社会道德价值的争议实际上是关于美国社会的哪些方面将被用作评估的指标以及用什么比较基线来评估它们的争议。事实上，关于它们的争议。所有社会现象的道德价值都可以归结为涉及这两个因素的争议。）

评价命题在社会研究中很常见，但是，由于伦理中立的规范，一些理论家更倾向于使他们的价值判断更加潜在而不是公然。在没有明确说明他们对社会现象的评价的情况下，他们可以通过证明这种社会现象与其道德地位被普遍接受的另一种社会现象相似的方式来隐含地传达他们的评价。通过这种策略，Goffman在Asylums中巧妙地通过展示他们与集中营有多少共同特征来巧妙地判断精神病院的道德状况。

B - 多重现象之间的关系

（viii）相互关系

a。似乎是无关的（独立的）现象实际上是相关的（相互依赖的）现象。

15 

例：August Hollingshead在社会阶层和精神疾病方面的断言，认为社会阶级和精神疾病在他写作不相关时被认为是相关的。

湾 似乎是相关的（相互依赖的）现象实际上是不相关的（独立的）现象。

例如：Emile Durkeim在自杀中断言自杀以及精神病理状态，种族，遗传和气候等其他现象，这些现象在他写作相关时被认为是实际上是不相关的。

评论：社会科学中的现代计算机技术既允许又促进大量命题的多产，这些命题涉及不感兴趣的现象（类型（viii））之间的相关性。这些相关命题是无趣的，因为它们是显而易见的，因为每个人都已经知道有关现象是相关的。这种罕见的计算机相关性引起人们对每个人都没有预料到的现象之间令人惊讶的关系的关注。定性相关性比定量相关更可能是有趣的，因为与计算机不同，人类的头脑被编程（以不同程度的清晰度）与本文中描述的有趣命题的构建的附加规则。这个额外的一步'

社会理论家已经指出了之前被认为是不相关的现象之间的许多有趣的相关性。使用类型（viii）一个命题，他们断言在社会组织和文化（马克思，涂尔干），社会和自我（Cooley，Mead），群体压力和个人感知（Asch），生活水平和人口等看似无关的现象之间建立联系。增长（马尔萨斯），出生顺序和人格特质。

社会理论家已经指出，被认为相关性较低的现象之间缺乏相关性，而不是被认为不相关的现象之间存在相关性。类型（viii）b的有趣命题比类型（viii）a的有趣命题更为罕见，因为社会理论家的观众认为社会现象与他们假设社会现象相关时更不相关。尽管如此，社会理论家已经断言了一些有趣的现象，这些现象之间的联系已被假设，例如自我与身体之间的脱节

16 

（米德，戈夫曼）以及权力与权威之间的脱节（托克维尔）。

在大众媒体中，也许是类型（viii）命题和类型（viii）b命题的最佳例子可以在试图将各种形式的吸烟和各种形式的疾病联系起来。第一次发表的研究发现吸烟与疾病之间存在统计相关性，引起了公众的兴趣，因为公众以前认为这两种现象之间没有联系（类型（viii）命题）。公众的兴趣也引起了第一次发表的研究，这些研究发现大麻吸烟与疾病之间几乎没有统计学相关性，因为公众以前认为这两种现象之间有很强的联系（类型（viii）b命题）。

（ix）共存

一个。似乎可以共存的现象实际上是不能同时存在的现象。

例如：Denis de Rougemont在“西方世界的爱情”中断言爱情和婚姻在他写作兼容的时候被认为是不相容的。

湾 似乎不能同时存在的现象实际上是可以共存的现象。

示例：西格蒙德·弗洛伊德在“关于强迫和仇恨的强迫和仇恨案例的笔记”中的断言实际上是兼容的（在心理上的矛盾心理状态），这种情况在他写作不相容时被认为是兼容的。

评论：这种类型的有趣命题在社会科学中相对较少，因为很少有一对或一组社会现象被认为是彼此如此不相容，以至于它们否定了彼此的存在。然而，类型（ix）b命题更常见的是类型（ix）一个命题：当假设两个或多个社会现象不相容时，它们通常被认为是非常不相容的，因此有趣的可能性很大。只要它们被声称共存就会发生; 而当假定两个或两个以上的社会现象是兼容的，它们通常被认为是弱相容，因此的颠簸

17 

有趣的是不容易时，他们都声称是不能共存的发生。

由类型（ix）b命题的动态模糊性产生的强烈兴趣鼓励它们被用作灵感的标题和捕捉短语。“孤独的人群”，“冷战”（即“和平战争”）和“丰富中的贫困”实际上都是椭圆形的类型（ix）b命题。

（x）共同变异

a。现象之间似乎是积极的共同变化实际上是现象之间的负共同变化。

示例：大卫卡普洛维茨在“穷人报酬”中的断言更多的商品和服务的支出，在他写的时候考虑在低收入水平下降，实际上在较低的收入水平上增加。

湾

例如：亚历克西斯·德·托克维尔在“旧政权”和“法国大革命”中的断言，一个社会团体渴望革命，当时他的写作随着他们的生活水平的提高而降低，实际上随着他们的生活水平的提高而增加。

评论：有两种其他类型的共同方差命题可以引起人们的兴趣：（1）似乎是现象之间的连续（增量）共同变化实际上是一种不连续（离散）的共变。马克思主义关于数量变化突然变成质变的观点涉及这种类型的命题。（2）似乎是现象之间的线性共同变化实际上是曲线共变。这种类型的命题发生在每个极端被认为聚集在一起时，即彼此更加相似而不是它们的意思。

当原始社会

18 

和现代社会被认为在一些特征上比在历史上干预社会时更加相似时，工人被认为在一些特征上更加相似，然后是中层管理人员 - 和（c）历史 - 人口相关性。

（xi）反对者

a。看似相似（几乎相同）的现象实际上是相反的现象。

示例：Marshall McLuhan在“理解媒体”中断言，当时他写作类似媒体时被认为是广播和电视，实际上是对媒体（一种是热媒;另一种是酷媒体）。

湾 似乎相反的现象实际上是类似的（几乎相同的）现象。

例如：Eric Hoffer在The True Believer中断言，那些加入反对社会运动的人的心理动机实际上是相似的。

评论：当反对命题，特别是类型（xi）b与评价命题相结合，尤其是类型（vii）b时，我们有相对形式化的技术来产生被称为辩证思维的有趣命题。社会理论家使用这种辩证思维技巧，试图通过断言一个看似积极的社会现象实际上具有相反社会现象的消极特征，或偶尔反之亦然来引起观众的兴趣。也许最着名的辩证思维的例子是马克思主义（实际上是蒲鲁东）断言“所有权是盗窃”。

有时必须加入一个转型过程，以确定明显的对立面 - 如“厌恶被压抑的欲望”和“婚姻是合法化的卖淫”。然而，这种转型过程仅仅使命题成为可能，并且对其影响贡献很小。命题影响的强度不是由于其形容词和无应力的转换过程，而是由于其突然的逻辑和评价逆转的一两个冲击。

虽然这种对公认的概念和价值观的双重否定对大陆社会理论家有吸引力，但对于英美思想来说，这往往过于极端，因此倾向于认为辩证命题更奇怪而不是有趣。因此他们

19岁

当英国人奥威尔在1984年以“自由是奴隶”，“战争就是和平”，“无知就是力量”这样夸张的例子来讽刺这些辩证主张时，掌声响起。

（xii）因果关系

a。似乎是因果关系中的独立现象（变量）实际上是依赖现象（变量）。

例如：霍华德贝克尔在局外人中断言，某些人的特殊行为，当时他写的是为了让其他人给他们贴上偏差的标签，但实际上是由其他人给他们贴上了偏差。

湾 似乎是因果关系中的依赖现象（变量）实际上是独立现象（变量）。

例如：马克斯·韦伯在“新教伦理与资本主义精神”中断言，社会宗教在他写作时被认为是由社会经济决定的，实际上决定了社会的经济。

评论：类型（xii）命题通过扭转现象之间通常假设的因果关系来唤起兴趣，在流行社会学中尤为常见。这类新闻主题是“芝加哥七个阴谋案中美国司法系统如何实际审判”，“受害者如何实际犯罪”和“学校如何破坏童年”最终都是基于类型（xii）命题。

存在第三种因果命题，它们激发了对前两者的基础假设的兴趣：现象之间似乎是一种简单的单向因果关系实际上是现象之间复杂的相互作用。读过马克斯韦伯的整个宗教社会学的学者们不断指出，他并不完全将宗教或经济定义为独立或依赖现象，因为只读过他的新教伦理的痴迷者; 相反，他实际上表明了社会的宗教和经济如何相互影响彼此的发展。

第三部分：讨论
1.非有趣的主张

20

我们已经看到观众发现一个有趣的命题，不是因为它告诉他们一些他们不知道的真相，而是因为它告诉他们一些他们认为已经知道错误的真相。换句话说，一个有趣的命题是否定其观众的假设基础的一些方面，并且在“有趣的索引”中，我们已经对这个假设的各个方面进行了分类 - 可以否定的理由。由于这是有趣命题的定义特征，因此它也可以用作判断特定命题是否有趣的标准。

如果观众判断一个特定命题有趣的标准是它否定了他们的假设基础的某些方面，那么他们判断一个特定命题是无趣的标准是它不否认某些方面他们的假设基础。有三种方式，命题可以不能否认其受众的假设基础的某些方面，因此有三种一般类型的命题将被观众发现不感兴趣。

首先，观众会认为一个命题是无趣的，如果这个命题不是否认他们的假设理论的某些方面，那么这个命题肯定了他们假设的某些方面。（例如：“丈夫经常影响他们的妻子的政治行为” “）实际上，这个命题正在向观众说：事实上似乎就是这种情况。你一直以为真的是真的。现象学是本体论。观众对这类命题的回应将是：“这很明显！”

其次，观众会认为一个命题是无趣的，如果不是否认或肯定他们的假设基础的某些方面，那么这个命题根本不会涉及这个假设的任何方面。（例如：“爱斯基摩人比犹太人更有可能......”）实际上，这个命题正在向观众说：真实的东西与你一直认为的真实无关。现象学与本体论无关。观众对这种命题的回应将是：“那是无关紧要的！”

第三，观众会认为一个命题是无趣的，如果这个命题不是否定其假设的某些方面，那么这个命题就会否定整个假设。（例如：“社会因素对一个人的行为没有影响。”）实际上，这个命题正在向观众说：似乎并非如此。你一直以为真的一切都是假的。

21 

现象是完全违背本体。观众对这种命题的回应将是：“这太荒谬了！”

为什么有人会费心主张一个无趣的主张呢？非有趣的社会理论通常是那些认为社会科学家的生意只是主张任何可以根据理论建构和验证的教科书规则得出和确认的理论的人故意宣称的。实际上，社会科学中的平庸（也可能是自然科学）可以被定义为那些过于字面和过于专注地采用科学程序教科书规则的人。从上面的讨论中可以清楚地看出，那些缺乏所谓“创造性火花”的人实际上是那些没有考虑到他们观众的假设理由的人。

但即使是社会科学之星，也有时会断言被认为是无趣的命题。为什么会出现这种情况？除了偶尔堕落的星星本身变成平庸之外，错误可能不在于星星，而在于他们的观众。只有在某些受众的假设基础上，命题才有趣或无趣。如果观众发现一个声誉良好的社会科学家断言的主张是显而易见的或不相关的或荒谬的，那么可能是因为该主张已经引起了听众的注意，而不是最初想要的听众。一个仅仅肯定一个特定假设的命题，与任何假设无关，或者湮灭整个假设 - 一个受众可能已被制定为否定一个特定的假设，与某些假设相关，或与其他观众的整个假设相协调。对于外群体观众而言，今天常见的是监视最初针对群体内观众的意外命题。今天的学术世界由专业的子世界（学科）组成，这些世界彼此之间以及从常识世界变得越来越不同（Berger和Luckmann，1966），但这也试图翻译他们内部产生的命题。到其他学科和常识世界。遇到这些跨学科或普及命题之一的受众可能会发现它没有意义，因为这个命题并没有专门设计来考虑这些新受众的假设。对于外群体观众而言，今天常见的是监视最初针对群体内观众的意外命题。今天的学术世界由专业的子世界（学科）组成，这些世界彼此之间以及从常识世界变得越来越不同（Berger和Luckmann，1966），但这也试图将他们内部产生的命题转化为到其他学科和常识世界。遇到这些跨学科或普及命题之一的受众可能会发现它没有意义，因为这个命题并没有专门设计来考虑这些新受众的假设。对于外群体观众而言，今天常见的是监视最初针对群体内观众的意外命题。今天的学术世界由专业的子世界（学科）组成，这些世界彼此之间以及从常识世界变得越来越不同（Berger和Luckmann，1966），但这也试图将他们内部产生的命题转化为到其他学科和常识世界。遇到这些跨学科或普及命题之一的受众可能会发现它没有意义，因为这个命题并没有专门设计来考虑这些新受众的假设。

2.使社会因素变得复杂

如果观众会发现有趣的任何命题攻击他们所持有的关于其ic的假设，那么可能所有人必须做的就是断言一个有趣的

22 

命题，首先，指明观众关于任何ic的假设是，第二，提出反驳它的命题。不幸的是，通常很容易想出一个反驳受众假设的命题（一个需要简单地参考上述有趣命题的索引）; 通常很难准确地指出这种可能被否定的受众假设是什么。

指定关于ic的受众假设通常很困难，因为这种假设不一定是单一的。自马克思以来，我们已经意识到，理论假设的社会基础内的任何分歧都可能导致理论假设内部的分裂 - 基础本身。由于观众经常按照各种社交线路进行细分，因此关于由一个观众群体持有的ic的假设可能与关于由另一个观众群体持有的ic的假设不一致。为了澄清指定受众假设所涉及的困难，让我们考虑一些最重要的受众群体，其中任何想要宣称其目标受众的所有成员都会感兴趣的主张必须考虑其假设。

观众社会结构的基本分歧在于那些持有关于特定ic的常识性假设的人和那些关于ic的假设受其知识专业或学科限制的人（Berger和Luckmann，1966）。这是对一方有“传统智慧”的外行人和对另一方有“深奥知识”的专家之间的分歧。在这两个领域中的每一个领域中，可能发生进一步的细分，使得更难以指定所有观众假设，并因此创建将被发现普遍有趣的命题。

关于外行人和专家所持有的关于ic的假设可能过于多样化或过于无定形，因此任何有关此ic的命题都会被普遍感兴趣。外行人对ic的假设的变化可能与通常的社会学范畴 - 年龄，性别，阶级等 - 或者一些更微妙的社会学范畴有关。专家对ic的假设的变化通常与他们在特定学科或在该学科中争夺权力的思想流派中的成员关系不同。如果没有关于假设的专家或专家共识的ic那么说一些有趣的话就不容易了。如果对似乎是什么情况没有达成共识，很难否认似乎是这种情况。

23

关于ic的谎言和专家假设可能不仅在社交空间上有所不同，而且还会随着时间的推移而变化。由于过去假设的共识通常被认为大于当前假设的共识，那些希望主张有趣命题的人经常试图反驳他们所谓的ic的“传统观点”。但在实践中，过去的传统假设通常被证明与当代假设一样难以确定。

此外，外行人和专家认为对于ic来说是真实的，不仅改变了过去，而且正在改变未来。特别是年轻一代开始理所当然地认为关于ic的新假设不同于老一代的理所当然的假设。年轻人越来越多地接受这种新的假设可能被称为先锋假设.3 

如果主张所有外行或所有专家都感兴趣的命题的主要问题涉及他们的基线假设通常无形或浮动的事实断言命题的主要问题是外行和专家都会感兴趣，这一问题涉及这样一个事实，即他们各自的基线假设往往是不相称的。

虽然现在已经普遍认识到各种知识专业的领域已经脱离了常识世界（Berger和Luckmann，1966），但这一事实对命题生成的影响尚未明确。在现象学层面上，传统智慧和深奥知识之间的这种分裂发生在断言命题时，否定了常识世界的假设。当各种自封的专家群体开始接受那些驳斥了外行假设的命题时，形成了知识分子专业。作为一种智力专业的发展，仅仅作为一种反驳一种被认为是对常识性世界的假设的命题的命题现在本身就成了一种被认为是理所当然的假设。当一个知识专业达到成熟 - 这是重要的一点 - 所有在其中产生的命题都不会被回溯到常识世界的新的基准，而是回到所采用的新基线。 - 被授予对知识专业本身的假设。换句话说，一种从与常识世界的假设辩证关系开始的知识分子专业，通过具有自己基本假设的内部辩证法发展和进步。

24 

任何希望主张一个将被外行和专家认为有趣的命题的人都必须处理这种双重辩证法的困境。一方面，他的主张只有在否认其专业的基础假设时才会引起专家的兴趣。另一方面，只有当它否定了常识世界的基础假设时，他的命题才会引起外行。但是，由于专家的地面假设已经剥夺了外行人的基础假设，他会发现利益专家的任何主张（因为它否认他们的地面假设）都不会让外行感兴趣（因为它肯定了他们的基础假设） ），反之亦然。一个人会感兴趣的是另一个人会很明显。

在学术界，一个人通常通过抓住一个角而忽略另一个角来解决这个困境，通过限制潜在的观众，他们会考虑他的主张而不是担心外行的观点。他通常会在专业期刊或技术文本中公布他的命题，只有那些持有他希望攻击的基础假设的同事才会对其进行审查。但请注意，这些专业期刊和技术文本的命题实际上是这样的形式：每个人，除了关于这个主题的专家，认为是真的，实际上是真实的。

在提议提请非专家注意之前，没有人会认识到这个命题是这种形式的。然而，一个人的命题越多，他的领域专家就越感兴趣，他就越想引起这些非专家的注意。如果他愚蠢地揭示了他的同事对他的非专业朋友感兴趣的主张，他通常会发现他们没有留下深刻的印象。如果他更愚蠢到通过在报纸和杂志上普及这个命题向更广泛的公众传播这个命题，他只会说服更多的人了解他的学科的贫困。

总而言之，知识专业的基线假设和常识世界的基线假设是不相称的这一事实导致了这样一个事实，即在前者中有良好接受的命题通常会在后者中得到较差的接受。那些试图普及专家们发现有趣的命题的人，往往必须采用行话来掩盖知识分子专题话语世界与常识世界话语世界之间根本缺乏互译性。他们直觉地（如果不是有意识地）意识到专家命题的有趣性，就像外国作家的诗歌一样，是翻译中失去的东西

.25 

3.不复杂的社会因素

考虑到所有不同观众群体的所有假设，一个命题必须反应才能被认为是有趣的，所以任何人都曾提出引起广泛兴趣的命题是一个奇迹。但是，一些社会理论家偶尔会发出通常被认为有趣的命题，这一事实应该提醒我们，产生有趣命题的问题并不像它最初出现时那么复杂。

尽管观众群体存在多样性，但在某种抽象层面上，观众假设只有二元性。因此，一个人可以用来简化他的观众的假设的一种技术是提高他认为的抽象水平。他的命题攻击观众的假设的抽象程度越高，他的观众的假设就会越多。最终，就像在有趣的索引中一样，他将能够达到这样的抽象水平，在这个抽象水平上，只有两个关于ic的观众假设可能。他的观众可能有很多片段，但是，在某个抽象层次上，每个片段必须假定关于特定ic的“X”或“非X”，因此，每个细分市场都会发现一个命题，即一个主张“非X”反对其假设“X”的命题，或一个主张“X”反对其假设“非X”的命题。例如，尽管每个人认为特定现象可以推广的程度可能不同，但是提出定义现象的抽象层次的社会理论家可以将他的所有观众群划分为两组：那些抽象地思考这一点的人。定义的现象是可以推广的，那些认为这种抽象定义的现象只是局部的。以这种方式对他的细分受众群进行了分类，他现在可以通过断言这种现象实际上是本地的，或者他可以通过断言这种现象实际上可以推广而对后一组观众群感兴趣，从而对前一组观众群感兴趣。通过将他的命题指向那些构成多数的观众群体的假设，或者至少是那些对他来说意义重大的人群的大多数，社会理论家会发现他的命题将引起广泛的，甚至是普遍的兴趣。

如果他仍然想要寻求普遍的利益，而不仅仅是多数利益，那么社会理论家就可以拥有另一种手段。他将观众群体的假设数量减少到两个，他可能希望进一步减少这种假设的二元性。他可能希望将他所有观众群体的假设基础凝聚成一个团结，将他的许多对手聚集到一个对手 - “敌人”。将要反驳的所有假设

26 整合

到“另一方”的单一（错误）假设中的修辞技术可称为共识创建。

共识创造是一项涉及三个步骤的巧妙任务。首先，社会理论家普遍表达缺乏共识（“一半认为'X'和一半认为'非X'。”）或沿着特定社会学范畴的界限（“下层阶级认为'X'，而上层阶级认为“非X”。或者适合于知识分子专业的类别（“结构 - 功能主义者认为'X';符号 - 互动主义者认为'非X'。”第二，他声称这显而易见纠纷实际上是更高层次的共识。（“但这两个群体实际上都在说同样的事情：'Y'。”）最后，在创造了更高的假设共识之后，他现在准备否认它。（“但是，他们都错了。

现在，社会理论家观众的所有部分都会发现他的命题很有意思，因为它反驳了所有人的共同基本假设（他们自己可能都不知道这些基本假设，直到他向他们指出他们所做的一切都是根本假设的）。然而，说服一个观众他们从根本上持有关于ic的特定假设，需要的不仅仅是修辞技巧。它还需要了解观众对ic实际持有的假设。假设一个社会理论家试图说服他的观众他们实际上认为他们实际上持有的假设过于不一致，

无论是常识世界还是他的知识分子专业世界，社会理论家都可能试图围绕传统假设，当代假设或先锋假设创造一个潜在可反驳的假设。对于这三者而言，这种具有时间特异性的共识创造形式包括选择一些代表作家 - 过去，现在或预言 - 作为目标，向他们展示所有关于特定ic的基本相同的事情，并声称他们的共同立场这个ic体现了Refutandum--社会理论家试图反驳的所有各种表现形式的时间的基本假设。例如，在社会学的情况下，必须证明一些社会学家不仅代表社会学传统，而且代表社会学传统; 不仅仅是当今一些社会学家的立场，而是社会学家目前的立场; 不仅仅是社会学的一种可能趋势，而是社会学的未来趋势。如果社会理论家也能说服他

27 

听众，这些代表作家承担有关IC是什么，其实他有什么观众自己承担有关IC -只有不到铰接-然后他设置上为他的观众的注意力争夺战将于阶段。他现在准备发起针对观众的假设的攻击，以捕获并保持他们的兴趣。他在这项努力中取得成功的可能性因为他很清楚观众的假设中的弱点，以及 - 作为向观众阐明这一假设的人 - 他自己已经掌握了它的建构而得到了加强。

虽然创造信念的逻辑步骤以QED（Quod Erat Demonstrandum！）结束，但是利益的修辞步骤以QER结束（Quod Erat Refutandum！）。

对于社会理论家而言，要产生一个在常识世界和他的知识分子世界中都很有趣的命题要困难得多，因此通常不会尝试这样的任务。然而，在某些情况下，尝试提出一个提议引起这种普遍的兴趣是值得的。

当他们关于它的ic的假设恰好排成一线时，外行和专家会发现同样的命题很有趣; 但是，由于我们已经看到的原因，他们对于ics的假设通常是不同步的。然而，外行和专家的假设偶尔会进入阶段，因为虽然两者的假设都是以上述辩证方式演变的，但前者的假设变化比后者的假设更慢，有时会分两个阶段背后。当这种情况发生时，一般感兴趣的提议成为可能。

另一个原因是，社会理论家难以主张一个对外行和专家感兴趣的主张是，专家有假设的ics通常是如此模糊，以至于非专业人士根本没有对这些ics的假设。（在自然科学中更是如此。）然而，社会理论家可以让外行人对这些深奥的专家命题感兴趣，如果他能首先让他们感受到做出假设的必要性和价值 - 任何假设 - 这些ics。他可以通过首先证明其对正在进行的实践活动的具体影响，使外行人员成为重要的 - 即使其成为正在进行的理论活动的主题。即使Refutation是父亲，重要性也是利益之母。

4.进一步研究有趣命题的含义

28 

我希望再次强调这样一个事实，即我并不打算将“有趣的指数”作为确定性。收集和有趣命题的分类都需要进一步完善。

应该开发一种更复杂的识别有趣命题的方法。在社会学的情况下，对社会学家进行调查可能会很有成效，他们会要求他们“为你最喜欢的五个社会学命题命名”。或者可以分析那些为了突出美国社会学家而选择的社会学命题，以便了解该专业官方机构的工作人员认为有趣的内容。引起一般兴趣的社会学命题也可以在Bobbs-Merrill Reprint系列或所选读数的各种流行文本中选择重印的文章中找到。

还应该开发一个更正式的有趣命题类别系统。它可以按照亚里士多德在他的组织中开发的所有可能命题（判断）的类别系统的模型，康德的纯粹理性批判，他的逻辑中的黑格尔，或者一些更近期的系统。此外，在较低抽象级别上指定其子类别将增加类别系统的有用性。

读者可能希望调整有趣命题的类别系统以供个人使用。他可以通过试图在“有趣的指数”中找到他自己总是觉得有吸引力的社会理论来非正式地做这件事。那些容易位于类别系统中的人将为他提供他自己感兴趣的一般社会理论类型的主观相关知识。那些不容易位于类别系统中的人将为他提供客观相关的知识，为了包含它们，应该如何修改或扩展有趣的索引。

正如我们所看到的那样，刺激观众对某一特定主张的兴趣是在一个修辞问题上。因此，我们可以通过研究关于艺术和修辞实践的古典和现代论文来获得对用于引起观众兴趣的修辞策略的额外洞察。

发现一些理论引起兴趣而其他理论没有兴趣的事实的心理基础也是有用的。格式塔心理学很可能是对有趣理论进行心理学解释的最富有成效的方法。它高度发达

分析引起感知兴趣的对象如何涉及突出其背景的数字提供了一个有趣的平行与上述分析如何引起认知兴趣的命题涉及与其假设理由相悖的断言。

除了可以引起兴趣的命题之外还有其他一些东西，比如绘画和人。也许我们也可以了解他们的吸引力，如果我们也从预期和惊喜的角度来看待他们。然后我们可能会发现绘画很有趣，因为它们的形式或内容违反了公认的审美规则，而人们的性格或行为与地位和角色期望相矛盾是有趣的。然而，在得出任何结论之前，必须使这些偏离规范的程度和方式更加明确。

最后，对社会（和自然）科学中有趣命题的进一步研究可以帮助我们更多地了解常识世界的理论结构。如果那些被发现有趣的命题确实是那些否定这种传统结构的各个方面的命题，那么我们就可以通过研究那些否定它的有趣命题来间接地理解这种传统结构的本质。此外，我们也可以间接地通过研究那些在某些社会场所感兴趣但在其他社会场所不感兴趣的个人的命题来间接地了解这种传统结构的变化。然而，无论命题的真实性如何，仅仅有人发现它有趣的事实表明我们可以从中学到很多东西。

5.有趣命题对进一步研究的启示

对大多数当代社会研究和特别是社会学研究的共同批评是，它是沉闷的，它说的是每个人都知道什么或者没人关心什么。正是社会科学今天普遍采用的方式存在缺陷 - 可能比任何其他单一原因更多 - 导致他们的学科地位相对较低，因为他们吸引优秀学生的能力相对较低，相对较低他们在公众甚至自己的修炼者中引起的热情很低。为了发现他们目前昏睡的原因并提出治疗方法，我将尝试揭示前面关于使理论命题变得有趣的讨论的社会学和特别是社会学研究的意义。希望，

三十

我们已经看到，区分有趣命题和非有趣命题的标准是前者与后者不同，否定其受众的特定假设。我相信，对所有在社会科学上留下印记的书籍和文章的分析将表明他们以“有趣的指数”中列举的各种方式满足这一标准。如果是这种情况，那么，社会科学目前的倦怠直接归因于社会科学家并不试图在他们自己的研究中始终如一地满足这一标准。他们自己的研究在其他有趣的事物上取得了哪些成功，这仅仅是因为他们无意中满足了这个标准。那些被认为是当今最有趣的社会科学家是直接将这一标准应用于他们自己的研究的人。然而，本文的目的是表明，如果社会生活的所有学生都被教导根据这个标准有意识地评估他们自己的研究，那么整个社会科学可以得到很大改善。

Glaser和Strauss（1967）敏锐地观察到，现代社会学的贫血状态主要源于这样一个事实，即大多数关于社会学方法的课程和教科书过于关注理论的确认而没有足够重视理论的产生。但格拉泽和施特劳斯并未恰当地指出这种缺陷的补救办法。所需要的不是更多的社会理论，而是更有趣的社会理论。社会生活的学生不仅需要知道如何从数据体中产生理论; 他需要知道如何从一组有趣的数据中产生一个理论。

格拉泽和施特劳斯认为，产生理论的先决条件是对数据的敏感熟悉。但我要补充一点，生成有趣理论的先决条件是对先前观众对数据的假设非常熟悉。有趣的是，一个理论必须与以前对所述现象的假设进行对比。观众不会发现有关精神病院的任何理论; 他们会发现只有那些与他们之前对精神病院的刻板印象相冲突的精神病院的理论才有意思。因此，想要确定他将产生关于他的主题的有趣理论的社会研究者必须首先熟悉他的观众已经认为对他的主题是真实的，

更一般地说，社会科学方法的课程和文本应该教会学生看到有影响力的社会理论的构建不会发生在

31

智力真空。理论建构的当前逻辑方法应该通过理论建构的方法来补充，这种方法不仅是我们所看到的现象学，而且是生态学，因为它不是一个使其有趣的理论的内在发展，而是它的外在关系。观众的假设。它不仅仅是告诉学生他的理论必须从数据中引出或从更抽象的原则推导出来的方式。学生还必须认识到他自己的关于ic的理论是在一个环境中形成的，在这种环境中，它必须与其至少一种其他理论竞争其观众的注意力和忠诚度的稀缺资源。另一个理论 - 首先到达那里 - 包括观众认为它已经知道的东西（即

简而言之，学生应该知道，在断言他自己关于这个ic的理论之前，他必须始终考虑他的观众关于ic的假设。他可以更明确地指出他的观众的假设，他将能够更加惊人地攻击它。否认明确理解的受众假设是有趣的本质。它将持久的研究与短暂的研究区分开来。使这种有意识地将观众假设意识作为其方法论程序的标准部分的那些学科将提高有趣命题相对于其学科内流通中的非有趣命题的比例，从而将提高其学科的有趣商数（IQ）相对于其他学科的有趣商数，

6.有趣和学术

对这里所阐述的有趣的分析也对社会（和其他）科学家的非研究活动产生影响，特别是在课程介绍和课程开发方面。

课程通常以增加结构化差异化的模型为基础。首先，在介绍性讲座中介绍了关于某些主题的一般理论。然后，这个一般的理论框架应用于

32的特定类别或实例

课程其余部分的主题。最后，在总结讲座中，总结了这一一般理论及其局限性和潜力。但是这种课程演示的结构方法往往无法理解学生的兴趣，因为它并没有特别关注学生发现的有趣内容。在理论构建的情况下，对主题的内部过程的过多关注以及对受众对主题的不断发展的观点的过度关注将使得彼此疏远。

然而，课程表现的现象学 - 本体论方法将克服结构方法的这种不足，因为它将始终关注学生关于主题的假设的演变。通过这种方法，课程将首先阐明学生关于主题的常识性假设，通过驳斥这些假设并将其替换为专家命题来继续，并通过快速概括，从而为学生表现，他对主题的原始天真观点转变为对主题的新的复杂观点的过程。这样的课程要求老师不仅要了解他想要吸引学生的目标，但也知道他们的起点 - 他的学生最初在哪里。任何课程的持续发展与学生的思维从头到尾的自然发展平行，都应该毫无困难地引出和维持他们的兴趣。

整个课程也应与学生的心理发展同步。今天大多数课程中对学生不断变化的假设的关注很少，这一事实导致学生经常觉得他们的教育缺乏相关性。由于幼稚的学生对主题的假设在入门级别被忽略，因此初学者特别容易发现入门课程（和课文）枯燥乏味。如果一个人的兴趣只是在他遇到意想不到的东西时才引起兴趣，那么他一定会找到一个沉闷的课程，因为它并不否认他的期望。也许是大多数入门课程的唯一意想不到的特点，它们唯一能够引起学生兴趣的赎回功能，

不幸的是，大多数入门课程对其主题的特定顺序仅仅包括该领域的经典陈述。虽然这些经典陈述对前几代专家感兴趣，因为他们否认了他们的假设，但这些经典陈述将无法引起目前

33 

学生的兴趣，因为今天的学生对前一代专家的主题事项没有做同样的假设。 。

然而，入门课程（和文本）确实在整个学科的课程中发挥了不可或缺的作用，因为它们为学生找到了有趣的高级课程（和课文）所必需的前提条件。入门课程产生了对高级课程中提出的主题专门设计为拒绝的主题的期望。由于有趣的辩证过程只有在对某一主题的特定假设形成后才能发生，学生通常会发现高级课程比入门课程更有趣。这并不是说入门课程 - 即使它们必须不如高级课程有趣 - 也必须像往常一样无趣。

最近，在该学院的某些部分，人们一直反对过度专注于复杂的专家主张。但这种反应似乎过分集中在学生的天真假设上。如果要维持学生的兴趣，应避免两种极端情况。在过去，学生对某一主题的兴趣往往受到过多关注专家最新结论以及对学生原始假设的过度关注的抑制。在将来，看起来学生对某一主题的兴趣可能会被过多关注学生的原始假设以及对专家最新结论的过分关注所抑制。然后学生们会对他们的天真观点不受干扰而感到厌倦，因为他们忽略了天真的观点。在任何一种情况下，都不会发生对有趣内在的原始假设的超越。我们需要的是一种教学方法，既考虑到学生对主题的天真观点作为其开始，又考虑了专家对主题作为其结束的复杂观点，并有条不紊地引导学生从一个到另一个。只有这样，学术这个术语才能成为不相关的同义词。

7.有趣的系统化？

在尝试构建有趣的索引时，我曾希望尽可能使其系统化。然而，当我继续这一尝试时，我发现 - 让我感到沮丧的是 - 我试图制作它的系统性越强，它变得越不有趣。我决定让我的困境本身作为对有趣和系统之间关系的一些思考的基础，而不是

34 

继续以降低兴趣的成本来推出我的系统。

在这个关键时刻，我正在以下列方式进行。从我有趣的命题文件中，我选择了一个我之前没有分类过的文章：“罗伯特默顿在清教主义，虔诚主义和科学中断言原教旨主义的新教和科学，在他写作的时候被认为是从两个完全不同的心理价值复合体，实际上是从相同的心理价值复合体发展而来的。“ 由此，我引出了它的逻辑范畴 - （xiii）。进化 - 及其一般类型 - （xiii）a“似乎是从完全不同的来源演化而来的现象实际上是由同一来源演变而来的现象。

根据我系统地阐述我的论文的程序 - 在以前的案例中运作得很好 - 与一般类型的有趣命题的逻辑相反也应该是一种有趣的命题的一般类型。但麻烦开始了。我找不到所谓有趣的类型（xiii）b命题的具体例子：似乎是从同一来源演化而来的现象实际上是由完全不同的来源演变而来的现象。我发现自己试图将几种顽固的社会理论强加于这种模式。注意到结果没有灵感，显然是人为的，我最终放弃了，决定不将我的论文扩展到这个新类别，

让我试着从我的特殊困难中抽象出所有理论家在试图既有趣又有系统时必须面对的一般困难。我会采取最简单的情况。理论家对现象（a）做出了有趣的断言。他的断言很有意思，因为它反驳了观众以前对现象的看法（a）。他发现他的断言对于现象（b）也很有意思，因为它也反驳了他的观众先前对现象的看法（b）。但后来他发现他所关注的两种现象 - 现象（a）和现象（b） - 具有逻辑关系，通过其自身的内部过程，产生第三种现象（c）和第四种现象（d） ）。

35 

ab 

aac 

bdb

现在，如果理论家希望系统化，他必须进一步将他的主张应用于现象（c）和现象（d）。但他并不能保证他对现象（c）和现象（d）的断言的系统应用仍然会很有趣，因为他的断言可能无法反驳他的观众先前对现象（c）和现象（d）的看法。

因此，伟大的理论家直觉地认识到他的主张可能会下降，因为这种主张被应用于越来越多的现象，通常只会暗示这些延伸，将其留给他的epigone来表达他的系统并系统地填补空白的框。这些不那么敏锐的追随者将机械地应用他们的导师最初的挑衅性断言，因为他们不会像他们的导师那样关注他们的观众已经掌握的关于这些新ics的预设。

系统开始有趣，但它们有很多逻辑和社会学必要性，不能以这种方式结束。人们通常必须在有趣和系统之间做出选择。人们不能轻易成为两者。

8.结论

现象学，正如我在这里使用的术语一般被使用，是对感觉水平的（仅仅）外观的研究，更重要的是对于我的目的，（仅仅）认知水平的假设。重点在于“仅仅”，因为称现象现象学意味着超越人们所看到或假设的东西更真实。但长期现象还有另一个更大的，这意味着-包括不仅仅是诱人假象和假设，但心灵的整个运动远离他们-黑格尔和胡塞尔开发

36 

朝本体论真。正是在这个整个过程的更大意义上，我试图在这些页面中展示的是社会学的现象学。

我断言所有有趣的社会理论都涉及到发现它们的观众心灵的某种运动。这些理论含蓄地阐明了发现它们有趣的观众的常规理所当然的假设，然后以更高或更基本的真理的名义否定这些假设。然而，不仅社会学建立在这种现象学过程的基础上，这种现象学过程同样建立在社会学的基础之上，因为每个观众群体的原始假设 - 这个过程的起点 - 在社会空间上有差异地分布。

因此，为了充分发展可称为有趣社会学的探究领域，社会学现象学研究观众心灵从一种被接受的社会理论到另一种社会理论的运动，必须与现象学社会学相结合。 ，研究了这种现象学过程开始的不同层级和专业观众群的不同基线理论。

将知识社会学与有趣社会学区分开来是很重要的。前者基本上是对信念和假设的研究; 后者基本上是对信念的崩溃和积累以及假设的转变的研究。可以肯定的是，知识社会学研究了意识形态的历史继承，但至少在其经典形式中（曼海姆，1936），它研究了信仰系统，好像它们是静态现象; 它将信仰系统的历史继承视为另一种静态意识形态相对突然地取代一种静态意识形态。另一方面，有趣的社会学具有更少的静态，更加动态的方向。它侧重于一个信念系统转变为另一个信仰系统的确切点。它侧重于对一些个人或群体持有旧理论假设的确切点，足以让他们开始找到一个有趣的新的 - 矛盾的 - 理论命题。它关注的是发现变化的精确社会学和现象学机制。然而，所有这些并不意味着知识社会学应该被有趣的社会学所取代。它确实意味着知识社会学应该被有趣的社会学所补充，因为从前者的角度来看，必须从前者的角度模糊化的我们不断变化的理论结构的关键方面将更清楚地揭示出来。

37

上述有趣的讨论为我们提供了一个与Thomas Kuhn（1962）给出的科学革命完全不同的模型。库恩粗略地认为，与先前的科学假设和解释程序（范式）异常的具体经验促使科学家们寻找一套新的科学假设和解释程序（范例）来解释异常经验而不是旧。但是，为了让大多数科学家不愿意在公认的概念方案中做出重大改变，直到一些具体的异常迫使他们将大多数科学家归结为一种保守主义和缺乏个人野心，即使在自然科学家中也不可能具有这种共同的个性特征。更不用说社会科学家。反对库恩，我认为，对于旧的常规接受的范式以及为自己命名的愿望的纯粹无聊将激励许多科学家寻找旧范式无法解释的异常，但可以用新的（最好是他们自己设计的）解释，而不仅仅是等待异常自己突然出现。通过将一个人的声誉与一个不断上升的新范式联系起来而不是成为一个衰落的旧范式的侍女，人们可以获得更多的职业地位。在智力学科中为自己命名的最好方法是有趣 - 否定假设，同时肯定意料之外的。

但是必须小心不要走得太远。在有趣和荒谬之间断言惊人和断言令人震惊之间有一条很好但确定的界限。我们看到，一个有趣的命题是否认了其观众的弱势假设。但那些试图否认观众强烈反对的假设的人将会对他们的理智产生质疑。他们将被指控为疯子; 如果科学家，他们将被称为crackpots。如果灵感与疯狂之间的差异仅在于他们选择攻击的特定受众假设的坚韧程度，也许正因为这个原因，天才一直被认为接近疯狂。

在这篇文章中，我试图提出一种分析理论命题的新方法。1相信同样重要的是要了解为什么理论被一些观众认为是有趣的，因为它是为了确定其内容的真实性或其形式的逻辑。

那么，这篇文章既是描述也是劝诫。这是一种描述，因为我试图指出那些使伟大的理论家的作品如此有趣的因素，这是一个劝诫，因为1促使我的读者更加意识到这些因素，以便自己做着作更多

38

有趣。我认为，有趣的理论的产生应该是与平淡的理论一样多的关注对象。本报告应该被视为对那些将伟大的理论家与平庸分开的“天才”残余类别的介绍性调查。所以呢？谁在乎？

注释
1然而，如果这个假设最近遭到其他人的强烈攻击，那么一个人可能会发现一个有趣的命题，肯定了他的一个假设。那些信仰最近被削弱的人欢迎对旧假设的新支持。（“就像我一直以为的那样！”）

2富有想象力的质量，有趣的理论家因拥有而受到赞扬，更少的是他们创造性地想象一些新奇的东西，而不是他们能够同情地想象别人认为是传统的东西。

3先锋队对年轻人的假设源于一个试图以下列方式反驳当代对旧的假设的命题。老一代人发现有趣的许多命题变成了年轻一代常规的假设。因此，那些对老一代感兴趣的命题 - 即那些试图反驳他们自己的理所当然的假设的命题 - 可能不再吸引年轻一代，因为这些命题可能不再对年轻一代有自己的辩证影响。理所当然的假设。他们已成为年轻一代的理所当然的假设！例如，弗洛伊德的见解，

4术语是未能将命题从一个话语世界转换为另一个。它通过实际上将其受众重新限制在那些首先发现它有趣的专家来保留命题的有趣性，因为行话只是与知识专业的基线假设相关的有意义的话语单元。

5虽然可以认为研究文章和书籍的“文献回顾”部分可以起到这种作用，但在大多数情况下，它并没有充分发挥作用。大多数社会研究者并不清楚地了解自己的文献回顾的目的是为了表达他们的观众的假设，而不是仅仅满足一

39

修辞仪式。他们也没有清楚地理解其他研究报告的目的是通过驳斥这些假设来增加我们的兴趣，而不仅仅是通过确认或忽略它们来“增加我们的知识”。

6如果有关于ic的其他公认理论不止一个，或者不清楚这个其他被接受的理论是什么，那么学生还必须处理前一部分中处理的初步问题，即勾结他的各种竞争对手。在他甚至试图征服他们之前，他们将自己的理论变成了一个竞争对手。“团结和征服”是每一位成功的社会理论家的座右铭。

7更确切地说：在某一点上，观众持有的假设越强烈，他们就会发现否认它的命题越有趣。但是在这一点之后，观众越是强烈地抱着一个假设，他们就会越多地考虑那些试图否认它的人。任何试图在此过程中否认观众对自然和社会现象的信念的人实际上是在攻击观众的理智。在这种情况下，观众只能通过指责他失去自己的理智来拯救自己的理智。
